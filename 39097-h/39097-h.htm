PREFACE
</p>

<div class="decoration"><img src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="Decoration" width="68" height="41"></div>
<p>
Prefaces remind me of a certain text of Scripture,&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, "the
last shall be first,"&#8212;for they are things written after which go
before! Whether or not they serve a useful purpose is hard to say. I
have several thousands of them in my library, most of which I have
read, and perhaps the fact that I am a reader of prefaces may mark me
as unique. And the mark may be accentuated to the gentle reader&#8212;if
this preface should have any&#8212;when I say that I am also one of the few
remaining authors who write them. Only one of my books is without a
preface,&#8212;though some of them are disguised as notes, or forewords, or
afterwords,&#8212;and I hereby apologize for the acephalous condition of
that volume.
</p>

<p>
I am determined that this book shall be amply provided, and though I
write the preface while I am sending back the proof galleys, yet I will
begin at the beginning. Beginnings are sometimes interesting, although
the interest of a beginning largely depends on the ending thereof. I
shall hope that this book in the end may commend itself sufficiently to
my indulgent readers to make the story of the beginning worth while.
</p>

<p>
"The years are many, the years are long," since a happy young sailor,
fresh from his graduation at the United States Naval Academy, spent
some of the pleasantest days of his life in the shadow of the old ship;
for there was a ship, just such a one as I have described, and in just
such a condition. There was a white house on the hill, too, and a very
old naval officer, who took a great interest in the opening career of
the young aspirant who passed so many hours lying on the grass amid the
mouldering ways, with the huge bulk of the ship looming over his head
and the sparkling waters of the bay breaking at his feet.
</p>

<p>
There were girls, too, and a sailor, and soldiers galore across the
harbor in the barracks, and back of all the sleepy, dreamy, idle,
quaint, and ancient little town. The story, of course, is only a
romance; but the setting at least is actual, and there is this touch of
realism in the tale: when the old ship was torn down to be made into
kindling-wood, a part of it fell upon one of the destroyers and crushed
the life out of him,&#8212;stern protest against an ignoble ending!
</p>

<p>
The idea of the story came to me twenty years ago. Indeed, in a brief,
disconnected way I set it down on paper and forgot it until I chanced
to resurrect it last year, when I threw aside the old notes and wrote
the story <i>de novo</i>.
</p>

<p>
I intend it as a character sketch of the old admiral, the veteran
sailor, the young officer, the innocent woman they all loved, and&#8212;dare
I say it?&#8212;the mighty ship. Here are contrasts, surely.
</p>

<p>
When I wrote "Hohenzollern," I thought it would be perfectly plain to
every one that it was not an historical novel. Vain hope! Yet I am not
discouraged by the lack of perception on the part of the critics.
Therefore I put this novel forth with a stronger confidence that it
will not be considered in that category. Save for what I have admitted,
there is not one word of history in it. Indeed, I have deliberately,
and because it was my fancy, chosen to appropriate the name of Admiral
Charles Stewart, "Old Ironsides,"&#8212;who did indeed live well into the
Civil War period, but who died under very different circumstances,&#8212;for
the name of the ancient captain in the white house on the hill. I
apologize to his <i>manes</i>, his descendants, and his friends for the
liberty.
</p>

<p>
Now, I do not write this because I wish to make any apology for the
historical novel. Not at all. The thing is slightly overdone at
present, but that is proof of its goodness. So far as I am concerned I
will stand by my guns. I love to read historic romances when they are
good, and I love to write them&#8212;even when they are as my own. I expect
to write more of them, too; but this really is not one. It is a war
story without any war, a sea story without any sea; yet it exhibits a
great struggle and rings with a great victory. The reader may
characterize it further at pleasure.
</p>

<p>
As for the second part of the volume I have called it Veracious Tales
advisedly, for all of these stories are founded upon facts in one way
or another. Some of them have been suggested to me by incidents with
which I am familiar because in them I bore a small part. The substance
of one of them came from a young English traveller who told a romantic
incident at a delightful dinner at the New York University Club. A real
diary suggested another. An historical mystery as to what became of a
certain cargo of slaves captured by Decatur in the Mediterranean evoked
a third. Neglected chapters in history and biography are responsible
for some of the others, as the Martinique tale, for the Diamond Rock
was once a ship! Sir Henry Irving's marvellous rendition of Matthias in
<i>The Bells</i> so possessed me with its power that after I came home
from the theatre I could not sleep until I had written the story. All
of these tales represent real incidents, therefore, or are founded upon
them in some way.
</p>

<p>
Writing a short story, with me at least, is very different from writing
a novel. I can invent plots of novels without the slightest difficulty,
but the making of a short story is different. The making is a case of
birth! The single incident, the brief condensed plot, or the vivid
character sketch which is necessary to a proper short story has to come
to me from outside. The short story is the product of inspiration, the
long story the result of labor. Perhaps, therefore, there is more truth
in the short story than in the long&#8212;from my point of view.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, in this volume are two kinds, and the readers may decide.
If they have half as much pleasure out of the book as I had, they will
thank me for having written.

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">The Building of the Ship</span>
</p>


<p>
Just half a century had elapsed since, cutting
down the virgin forest to make room for the
ways, they laid her keel blocks in the clearing.
With the cunning brain of Henry Eckford,
one of the greatest of our shipbuilders, to
plan, and the skilful hands of the New England
shipwrights to execute, with timber cut by the sturdy
woodsmen from where it stood in the forest, the giant
frames rose apace, until presently, in an incredibly
short time, there stood upon Ship House Point a
mighty vessel ready for the launching.
</p>

<p>
Ship House Point&#8212;so called from the ship&#8212;was
a long ridge of land sloping gently down from a low
hill and extending far out into Lake Ontario. It
helped to enclose on one side a commodious lake
haven known in that day, and ever since, as Sewell's
Harbor, from old George Sewell, a hunter, fisherman,
innkeeper, and trader, who had settled there
years before.
</p>

<p>
Thither, in the busy warlike days of 1813-14, had
resorted dashing naval officers in their ruffled shirts,
heavily laced blue coats, with their huge cocked hats,
skin-tight kersey pantaloons, and tasselled half boots.
In their wake rolled ancient tars in blue shirts and
flowing trousers, their mouths full of strange oaths
and tales of distant seas; some of the older veterans
among them still wearing their hair in the time-honored
pigtail of an already disappearing age.
</p>

<p>
On the bluff across the harbor mouth, and just
opposite to Ship House Point, a rude log fort had
been erected in 1812, a central block-house and a
surrounding stockade, mounting a few inconsiderable
pieces of artillery. From a tall staff on the parade
the stars and stripes fluttered in the wind, and nodded
in amicable salute toward a similar ensign which the
patriotic builders had hoisted on the Point.
</p>

<p>
Government storehouses filled with munitions and
supplies of various kinds, both for the naval forces on
the lakes and for the armies designed for the long
projected invasion of Canada likewise, stood back of
the wharves crowded with the miscellaneous shipping
of the suddenly thriving little town. Soldiers from
the fort, therefore, in blue and gray uniforms mingled
with the ship-carpenters, wood-cutters, pioneers, sailors,
and traders, and the spot speedily became one of
the busiest in the then far Northwest.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes in the offing the white sails of the English
or American squadrons could be seen, and on
the summer days from the distant horizon might have
been heard the dull boom of cannon telling a tale of
some spirited engagement. And more than once
thereafter a melancholy and shattered ship brought
in a ghastly cargo of dead, dying, and wounded, the
care of which heavily taxed the resources of the community;
and the women of the village&#8212;for there
were women there from the beginning&#8212;had grim
lessons, learned sometimes through breaking hearts,
that war was a more serious business than the gay
officers, the bright uniforms, the beautiful flags, and
the brave ships had indicated.
</p>

<p>
The town had sprung into being around Sewell's
store and tavern, amid all these activities and undertakings,
almost as if by magic&#8212;quite as the great
ship had risen on the shore, in truth. Men did things
in a hurry in those days, and no one was much surprised
when, some thirty days after the keel was laid,
the indefatigable Eckford informed stout old Commodore
Chauncey, the American commander on the
lakes, that the <i>Susquehanna</i>&#8212;for so the ship-of-the-line
which was to establish finally the American
preponderance of force over the British on Lake
Ontario was called&#8212;was ready for launching, and
great preparations were made in the very early spring
of 1815 for this important and interesting ceremony.
</p>

<p>
A few days before the appointed time, however,
there came to the impatient commodore, the persevering
builder, and the busy workmen a messenger
bearing a heartrending despatch, long delayed in
transmission, from the Secretary of the Navy. That
official announced that the war was over, that peace
with England had been declared at the close of the
preceding year, and directed that the preparations
for launching and completing the vessel must be at
once abandoned. It was a sore grief to Eckford
and his fellow-shipwrights, a great disappointment to
Chauncey and his brave seamen, and a terrible blow
to the thriving town. It had grown and flourished
in war, and it was to languish and die in peace&#8212;a
reversal of natural law apparently! But there was
no help for it. The orders had to be obeyed. The
war-ships on the lakes were broken up, or sold, and
a few were laid up in ordinary, the officers and men
were detached to the more congenial salt-water stations,
and the ship-carpenters were withdrawn to the
seaboard towns whence they had been collected.
The fort was dismantled, the garrison mustered out
of the service, and the storehouses emptied and
closed.
</p>

<p>
The young ship-of-the-line, hastily housed over,
was left alone with the abandoned town. The busy
place, its reasons for being gone, speedily sank into a
state of public decay. The deserted storehouses fell
into ruin; the once noisy wharves, unvisited by any save
an occasional small vessel, rotted away; the merchants
and traders closed out their stocks and departed; the
hunters and pioneers moved farther westward into
the vast wilderness extending its mysterious beckoning
call to their adventurous souls; the grass grew
thick in the silent streets, and it seemed as if the
death-sentence of the village had been written.
</p>

<p>
But as years sped away some of its pristine life
came back to it. The farmer again speeded his plow
and planted his corn in the clearings. Sheep and
cattle once more dotted the fields. A new order took
the place of the old. Country churches rose; little
feet plodded unwillingly toward a small red school-house,
where childish laughter and play at recess
mingled with tears over puzzling lessons and unsolvable
problems. The stores were opened one by one,
and a few vessels came back to the harbor. On
market days the farmers crowded the square with
their teams, the village awoke from its long sleep
and became a modestly thriving little country town
again,&#8212;drowsing on into life once more. And although
the very oldest inhabitants, remembering the
busy days forever gone, were not satisfied, the younger
people were content and happy in their pretty little
hamlet.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, what of the ship in all these changing
years? Time was when Ship House Point had been
covered with a virgin forest extending even to the
water's edge. It was now bare of trees, for the massive
trunks had been wrought into the fabric of the
ship, and no others had come to take their places.
There, neglected and unnoticed, she had stood naked
and gaunt for a long time, for the flimsy ship-house
covering her had been the first thing to go. Through
the swift years the burning sunshine of many summers
fell upon her green, unseasoned planks, and the
unsheltered wood shrinking in the fierce heat opened
her seams widely on every hand. Upon her decks
the rain descended and the snow fell. The storms
of bitter winters drove upon her in successive and
relentless attacks. The rough spring and autumn
gales tore from her huge sections of timber, leaving
gaping wounds, while the drying rot of time and
neglect penetrated her very heart.
</p>

<p>
Rust consumed the bolt-heads and slowly ate up
the metal that held her together. Yet in spite of all
she still stood, outwardly indifferent alike to the
attack of the storm or the kiss of the sun,&#8212;a mighty
monster towering high in the air, unfinished, incomplete,
inchoate, disintegrating, weaponless, but still
typifying strength and power and war. In spite of
her decay, in spite of her age, she looked the masterful
vessel she was designed to be.
</p>

<p>
The waves broke in winter in icy assault upon the
rocky shore on the seaward side, as if defying the
ship to meet them. They rippled on the shoals, on
the other hand, in summer with tender caressing
voices, wooing her to her native element, stretching
out white-fingered hands of invitation. And the air
carried the message of the waters into every hidden
recess in the most secret depths of the ship.
</p>

<p>
In some strange way, to those who grew to
know her, the ship seemed to live; they imbued her
with personality, and congenial spirits seemed to
recognize her yearning for a plunge into that all-embracing
inland sea. She hung poised, as it were, like
a bird ready for flight, and watchers standing within
her shadow divined her longing for that mad first
rush from the ways.
</p>

<p>
The ripple of the water had never curled along
that ship's massive keel; her broad bows had never
buffeted a way through the thunderous attack of the
storm-waves; she had never felt the ocean uplift;
the long pitch and toss, the unsteady roll and heave
which spoke of water-borne life had never been hers;
yet, looking at the graceful lines, the mighty frames,
the most unimaginative would have said that the old
ship lusted for the sea, and, in futile and ungratified
desire, passed her shore-bound days in earth-spurning
discontent.

CHAPTER II
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">His Last Command</span>
</p>


<p>
On the hill back of the Point, embowered
on three sides in the trees, which had
been cut away in front to afford a fair
view of the ship, the Point itself, and
the open waters of the lake beyond,
stood an old white house facing the water, with a
long covered porch, high-pillared and lofty, extending
across its entire front. Old, yet young compared to
the ship. Overlooking the ship, on a platform on the
very brow of the hill, a long, old-fashioned six-pound
gun was mounted on a naval carriage. Back of the
gun rose a tall flag-staff, and from the top fluttered
night and day a small blue flag with two stars, the
ensign of a rear-admiral. There were no masts or
spars upon the ship below the hill, of course, but aft
from the mouldering taffrail a staff had been erected,
and from it flew the stars and stripes, for during the
last half of her existence the ship had rejoiced in a
crew and a captain!
</p>

<p>
Some twenty-five years since a quaint old naval
officer had taken up his abode at the house on the
hill. With him had come a young sailor, who, disdaining
the house, had slung his hammock aboard
the ship,&#8212;finding a place between decks which, after
a few repairs, would shelter him from the storms.
When the old officer came, he hoisted at the mast
which was at once erected in the yard the broad
blue pennant of a commodore, and it was only after
Farragut had made his splendid passage up the Mississippi,
and awakened the quiet shores of the Father
of Waters with the thunder of his guns, so that the
title of commodore became too small for him, that
the old veteran had been promoted with other veterans&#8212;and
with Farragut himself&#8212;to the rank of rear-admiral,
recently established,&#8212;certainly a rank entirely
in consonance with his merit at least.
</p>

<p>
The old man had been practically forgotten, lost
sight of, in the glory accruing to the newer names
among the Civil War heroes; yet he had been among
the foremost in that great galaxy of sailors who had
made the navy of the United States so formidable in
the War of 1812.
</p>

<p>
Old men of the town, whose memories as children
ran back beyond even the life of the ship, recalled
having seen, in those busy, unforgotten days of
1814-15, many uniforms like to the quaint old dress
which the admiral sometimes wore on occasions of
ceremony; and there were some yet living who
remembered the day when the news came that the
mighty <i>Constitution</i> had added to her record the last
and most brilliant of her victories in the capture of
the frigates <i>Cyane</i> and <i>Levant</i>. The man who had
made the capture&#8212;who, when his wife had asked him
to bring her a British frigate for a present when he
set forth upon the cruise, had answered that he would
bring her two, and who had done it&#8212;was the man
who had been stationed in the white house on the
hill to watch over the old ship.
</p>

<p>
The battles and storms, the trials and cares, the
sorrows and troubles of eighty-five years had beat
upon that white head; and though he was now bent
and broken, though he tottered as he paced up and
down the porch after the habit of the quarter-deck,
though his eye was dim indeed and his natural force
greatly abated, he was still master of himself. When
the Civil War broke out his brave old soul had
yearned to be upon a heaving deck once more, he
had craved to hear the roar of guns from the mighty
batteries beneath his feet, to feel again the kiss of
the salt wind upon his tanned and weather-beaten
cheek. He had longed in the deadly struggle of
'61-'65 to strike another blow for the old flag he had
done so much to make formidable and respected on
the sea; but it was not to be. Superannuated, old,
laid up in ordinary, he quietly watched over the rotting
ship which was his last command.
</p>

<p>
In some strange way, with a sailor's superstition,
as the years had passed, as he had grown feebler and
the ship had grown older, he bound up his own term
of life with that of the vessel. While it stood he
should live, when it fell should come his end. He
watched and waited.
</p>

<p>
When the night threatened to be wild and stormy,
the report of the evening gun with which Captain
Barry invariably saluted the flag ere he struck it
would seem to him the sounding of his death-knell.
When the tempest howled around the old house, he
could hear, in fancy, above its wild screaming the
crashing of the timbers of the ship falling in shapeless
ruins on the mouldering ways. In the morning,
after such a night, he would rise and creep to the
door, totter out on the porch with the aid of his cane,
and peer down on the ship. Some portion of it
might have been swept away, perhaps, but if it still
stood he would feel that he had a respite for another
day.
</p>

<p>
Many a tall vessel had he commanded, many a
gallant frigate or great ship-of-the-line he had driven
through the tempestuous seas. Upon some of them,
as on the <i>Constitution</i>, he had won eternal fame, yet
never had he loved a vessel as his heart had gone out
to the rotting mass of this incompleted ship.
</p>

<p>
He did not dream, when he came there twenty-five
years before&#8212;an old man then&#8212;that either he or the
ship would last so long; yet there they both stood;
older, weaker, feebler, more broken, and breaking
with every passing hour, but still a ship and still a
captain.
</p>

<p>
During the years of their association the admiral
had unconsciously invested the ship with a personality
of its own. It seemed human to him. He
dreamed about it when he slept. He was never so
happy as when awake he sat and watched it. He
talked to it like a friend when they were alone.
Sometimes he reached his old trembling hand out to
it in a caressing gesture. He had long since grown
too feeble to go down to it; he could only look upon
it from afar. Yet he understood its longing, its dissatisfaction,
its despair. A certain sympathy grew up
between them. He loved it as it had been a woman.
He would fain have kissed its keel.
</p>

<p>
Yet the devotion the admiral felt for the ship was
scarcely greater than that which had sprung up in
the heart of the old sailor who lived aboard it.
</p>

<p>
Old John Barry had been a quartermaster on the
<i>Constitution</i>, and had followed the fortunes of his
captain from ship to ship, from shore to shore, until
he died. After that the duty of looking after the
captain devolved upon his son, young John Barry;
and when the commodore had been ordered to Ship
House Point, more with the intention of providing
him with a congenial home for his declining years
than for any other purpose, young John Barry had
followed him.
</p>

<p>
Young John Barry he was no longer. He was
fifty years old now, and, like the admiral, had unconsciously
made the life of the ship stand for his own
life as well. The witchery of disappointment and
regret, pregnant in every timber, bore hard upon him
also. He had been a gay, dashing, buoyant, happy-go-lucky
jack-tar in his day; but, living alone on
that great old ship, some of the melancholy, some of
the dissatisfaction, some of the longing, some of the
futile desire which fairly reeked from every plank had
entered his own rough and rugged soul.
</p>

<p>
The bitter wind had sung through the timbers of
the ship too many tales of might-have-been, as he lay
in his hammock night after night, not to have left its
impression upon him. He became a silent, taciturn,
grave old man. Of huge bulk and massive build, his
appearance suggested the ship-of-the-line,&#8212;strength
in age, power in decay. He loved the ship in his
way even as the admiral did.
</p>

<p>
Risking his life in the process, he climbed all over
it, marking with skilful eyes and pained heart the
slow process of disintegration. He did not kiss it,&#8212;kisses
were foreign to his nature, he knew nothing of
them,&#8212;but he laid his great hands caressingly upon
the giant frames, he pressed his cheek against the
mighty prow, he stretched himself with open arms
upon the bleaching deck, as if he would embrace the
ship.
</p>

<p>
When the storms beat upon it in the night, he
sometimes made his way forward and stood upon the
forecastle fronting the gale, and as the wind swept
over him and the ship quivered and shook and vibrated
under the tempestuous attack, he fancied that
he felt the deck heave as it might under the motion
of the uptossed wave.
</p>

<p>
He dreamed that the ship quivered in the long
rush of the salt seas. Then the rain beat upon him
unheeded. Wrapped in his great-coat in winter, he
even disdained the driving snow, and as he stood by
the weather cathead, from which no anchor had ever
depended, and peered out into the whirling darkness,
he seemed to hear the roar of a breaker ahead!
</p>

<p>
The ship was his own, his property. The loss of a
single plank, the giving way of a single bolt, was
like the loss of a part of himself. With it he lived,
with it he would die. Alone he passed his nights in
the hollow of that echo of the past. Sometimes he
felt half mad in the rotting vessel; yet nothing could
have separated him from the ship.
</p>

<p>
The little children of the adjacent village feared
him, although he had never harmed any of them,
and was as gentle as a mother in his infrequent
dealings with them all; but he was so silent, so grave,
so grim, so weird in some way, that they instinctively
avoided him. Their light laughter was stifled, their
childish play was quieted when Captain Barry&#8212;so
they called him&#8212;passed by. He never noticed it,
or, if he did, he gave no sign. Indeed, his heart was
so wrapped up in a few things that he marked nothing
else.
</p>

<p>
The old admiral, whom he watched over and cared
for with the fidelity of a dog,&#8212;nay, I should say of a
sailor,&#8212;was the earliest object of his affections. To
look after him was a duty which had become the habit
of his life. He cherished him in his heart along with
the ship. When the others had gone to their rest, he
often climbed up on the quarter-deck, if the night were
still, and sat late in the evening staring at the lights in
the house on the hill until they went out, musing in his
quaint way on the situation. When the days were
calm he thought first of the admiral, in stormy times
first of the ship. But above both ship and captain in
his secret heart there was another who completed the
strange quartet on Ship House Point,&#8212;a woman.
</p>

<p>
Above duty and habit there is always a woman.
</p>

CHAPTER III
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">The Woman and the Man who Loved Her</span>
</p>


<p>
The wife of the admiral, to whom he
had brought the flags of the two British
ships on that memorable cruise, had
long since departed this life. Her
daughter, too, who had married somewhat
late in life, had died in giving birth to a girl,
and this little maiden, Emily Sanford by name, in
default of other haven or nearer relationship, had
been brought, when still an infant in arms, to the
white house on the hill, to be taken care of by the
old admiral. In the hearts of both the old men she
divided affection with the ship.
</p>

<p>
With the assistance of one of the admiral's distant
connections, a faithful old woman, also passed to the
enjoyment of her reward long since, Emily Sanford
had been carried through the troubles and trials
incident to early childhood. At first she had gone
with other little children to the quaint red school-house
in the village. She had been a regular attendant
until she had exhausted its limited capacity for
imparting knowledge. After that the admiral, a man
of keen intelligence, of world-wide observation, and
of a deeply reflective habit of mind, had completed
her education himself, upon such old-fashioned lines
as his experience suggested. She had been an apt
pupil indeed, and the results reflected great credit
upon his sound, if somewhat unusual, methods of
training, or would have reflected had there been
any one to see.
</p>

<p>
In all her life Emily Sanford had never been away
from her grandfather for a single day; she had actually
never left that little town, and, except in school-time,
she had not often left the Point. Although just
out of her teens, she was not old enough to have become
discontented&#8212;not yet. She was as childlike,
as innocent, as unworldly and unsophisticated a maiden
as ever lived,&#8212;and beautiful as well. It was Prospero
and Miranda translated to the present. The old admiral
adored his granddaughter. If the ship was his
Nemesis, Emily was his fortune.
</p>

<p>
As for Barry the sailor,&#8212;and it were injustice to the
brave old seaman to think of him as Caliban,&#8212;he worshipped
the ground the girl walked on. He was in
love with her. A rude old man of fifty in love with
a girl of twenty; a girl immeasurably above him in
birth, station, education&#8212;in everything! It was surprising!
Had any one known it, however, it would
not have seemed grotesque,&#8212;only pitiful. Barry himself
did not know it. He was too humble and too
ignorant for self-examination, for subtle analysis. He
loved, and he did not comprehend the meaning of
the word! Even the wisest fail to solve the mysteries
of the heart.
</p>

<p>
Although the veteran seaman was too ignorant of
love rightly to characterize his passion, it was nevertheless
a true one. It was not the feeling of a father,
nor of a companion, nor yet that of a servant, though
it partook in some measure of all three. That was
an evidence of the genuineness of his feeling. Nothing
noble, no feeling that is high, self-sacrificing, devoted,
is foreign to love that is true, and love is the most
comprehensive of the passions&#8212;it is a complete obsession.
Captain Barry would have given his soul
for Emily Sanford's happiness, and rejoiced in the
bestowal.
</p>

<p>
He cherished no hopes, held no aspirations, dreamed
no dreams concerning any future relationship. He
was just possessed with an inexplicable feeling for her.
A feeling that expected nothing, that asked nothing,
that hoped for nothing but the steady happiness of
being near her. To be in sight, in sound, in touch,
that was all, that was enough. The sea in calmer
mood gives no suggestion of potential storms.
Barry's love was the acme of self-abnegation. If he
had ever reached the covetous point he would have
realized that she was not for him. He never did.
</p>

<p>
He loved her with a love beside which even his devotion
to the old admiral, the passionate affection he
bore for the old ship, were trifles. The girl had
grown into his heart. Many a time he had carried
her about in his arms when she was a baby. He had
played with her as a child; she could always call a
smile to his lips; he had cared for her as a young
girl, he had served her as a woman.
</p>

<p>
He, too, had been happy to contribute to her education as he had been able. There was a full-rigged
model of the <i>Susquehanna</i> in her room in the white
house. He had made it for her. It was a perfect
replica, complete, finished in every detail; so the ship
might have looked if she had ever been put in commission.
Emily knew every rope, every sheet, line, and
brace upon it. She could knot and splice, box the
compass, and every sailor's weather rhyme was familiar
to her. She could handle a sail-boat as well as
he, and with her strong young arms pulled a beautiful
man-o'-war stroke. He had taught her all these
things. When study hours were over and play-time
began, the two together had explored the coast-line
for miles in every direction.
</p>

<p>
So far as possible he had gratified every wish that
she expressed. If a flower grew upon the face of an
inaccessible cliff and she looked at it with a carelessly
covetous glance, he got it for her, even at the risk of
his life. He followed her about, when she permitted,
as a great Newfoundland dog might have done, and
was ever ready at her beck and call. His feeling towards
her was of so exalted a character that he never
ventured upon the slightest familiarity; he would have
recoiled from such an idea; yet had there been any to
mark, they might have seen him fondle the hem of
her dress, lay his bronzed cheek upon her footprint
in the sands, when he could do so without her
knowing it.
</p>

<p>
There was no man in the village with whom Emily
could associate on terms of equality. The admiral
had come from a proud old family, and all its pride of
birth and station was concentrated in his last descendant.
Simply as she had been reared, she could
not stoop to association with any beneath the best; it
was part of her grandfather's training. He was of a
day when democratic iconoclasm was confined to
state papers, and aristocracy still ruled the land by
right divine, even though the forms of government
were ostensibly republican. There were some quaint
old novels in the library, which the girl had read and
re-read, however, and, as she was a woman, she had
dreamed of love and lovers from over the sea, and
waited.
</p>

<p>
Her life, too, had been bound up with the ship.
Not that she feared an end when it ended, but she
often wondered what would happen to her when it fell.
What would she do when the admiral was gone?
And Captain Barry also? Who would take care of
her then? What would her life be in that great world
of which she dreamed beyond that sparkling wave-lit
circle of the horizon? Who would care for her then?
That lover who was coming? Ah, well, time would
bring him. Somewhere he lived, some day he would
appear. With the light-heartedness of youth she put
the future by and lived happily, if expectantly, in the
present.

CHAPTER IV
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">Cast up by the Sea</span>
</p>


<p>
One early autumn evening in 1865 the sun
sank dull and coppery behind banks of
black clouds which held ominous portent
of a coming storm. The old admiral sat
in a large arm-chair on the porch leaning
his chin upon his cane, peering out toward the horizon
where the distant waters already began to crisp
and curl in white froth against the blackness beyond.
Emily, a neglected book in her lap, sat on the steps
of the porch at his feet, idly gazing seaward. The
sharp report of the sunset gun on the little platform
on the brow of the hill had just broken the oppressive
stillness which preceded the outburst of the
tempest.
</p>

<p>
Having carefully secured the piece with the thoroughness
of a seaman to whom a loose gun is a
potential engine of terrible destruction, Barry ran
rapidly down the hill, clambered up on the high poop
of the ship, and hauled down the colors. As the flag,
looking unusually bright and brave against the dark
background of the cloud-shrouded sky, came floating
down, the admiral rose painfully to his feet and bared
his gray hairs in reverent salute. Emily had been
trained like the rest, and, following the admiral's example,
she laid aside her book and stood gracefully
erect, buoyant, and strong by her grandfather's side.
</p>

<p>
Old age and bright youth, the past with its history,
memories, and associations, the future with all its possibilities
and dreams, alike saluted the flag.
</p>

<p>
They made a pretty picture, thought Captain
Barry, as he unbent the flag, belayed the halliards,
and gathered up the folds of bunting upon the deck,
rolling the colors into a small bundle which he placed
in a chest standing against the rail at the foot of the
staff. It was a nightly ceremony which had not been
intermitted since the two came to the Point. Sometimes
the admiral was unable to be present when the
flag was formally hoisted in the morning, but it was
rare indeed that night, however inclement the weather,
did not find him on the porch at evening colors.
</p>

<p>
The smoke of the discharge and the faint acrid
smell of the powder&#8212;both pleasant to the veterans&#8212;yet
lingered in the still air as Barry came up the hill.
He stopped before the foot of the porch, stood with
his legs far apart, as if balancing to the roll of a
ship, knuckled his forehead in true sailor-like fashion,
and solemnly reported that the colors were down.
The admiral acknowledged the salute and, in a voice
still strong in spite of his great age, followed it with
his nightly comment and question:
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Barry, and handsomely done. How is the
ship?"
</p>

<p>
"She's all right, your honor."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more gone?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I thought I heard a crash last night in the gale."
</p>

<p>
"Not last night, sir. Everything's all ship-shape,
leastways just as it was since that last piece of the
to'gallant fo'k'sl was carried away last week."
</p>

<p>
"That's good, Barry. I suppose she's rotting
though, still rotting."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir, she is; an' some of the timbers you
can stick your finger into."
</p>

<p>
"But she's sound at the heart, Captain Barry,"
broke in Emily, cheerily.
</p>

<p>
"Sound at the heart, Miss Emily, and always will
be, I trust."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, lassie," said the old admiral, "we be all
sound at the heart, we three; but when the dry rot
gets into the timber, sooner or later the heart is
bound to go. Now, to-night, see yonder, the storm
is approaching. How the wind will rack the old
timbers! I lie awake o' nights and hear it howling
around the corners of the house and wait for the
sound of the crashing of the old ship. I've heard the
singing of the breeze through the top-hamper many a
time, and have gone to sleep under it when a boy;
but the wind here, blowing through the trees and
about the ship, gets into my very vitals. Some of it
will go to-night, and I shall be nearer the snug harbor
aloft in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't say that, grandfather! Sound at the
heart, the old ship will brave many a tempest, and
you will, as well."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, girl, but not many like yonder brewing storm.
Old things are for still days, not for tempests. What
think ye of the prospect, Barry?"
</p>

<p>
"It's got an ugly look, your honor, in the nor'west.
There's wind a plenty in them black clouds. I wish
we'd a good frigate under us and plenty o' sea room.
I lies on the old ship sometimes an' feels her shiver
in the gale as if she was ashamed to be on shore.
That'll be a hard blow, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said the admiral, "I remember it was just such
a night as this once when I commanded the <i>Columbus</i>.
She was a ship-of-the-line, Emily, pierced for one
hundred guns, and when we came into the Mediterranean
Admiral Dacres told me that he had never
seen such a splendid ship. I was uneasy and could
not sleep,&#8212;good captains sleep lightly, child,&#8212;so I
came on deck about two bells in the mid-watch.
Young Farragut, God bless him! was officer of the
watch. The night was calm and quiet but very dark.
It was black as pitch off to starboard. There was
not a star to be seen. 'Mr. Farragut,' I said, 'you'd
better get the canvas off the ship.' Just then a little
puff struck me in the cheek, and there was a sort
of a deep sigh in the still night. Barry, your father,
old John, was at the wheel, and a better hand at
steering a ship I never saw. 'Call all hands, sir,' I
said, sharply, 'we've no time to spare,' and by gad,&#8212;excuse
me, Emily,&#8212;we'd no more than settled
away the halliards when the squall struck us. If
it hadn't been for the quick handling and ready
seamanship of that youngster, and I saw that he
was master of the thing and let him have his own
way, we'd have gone down with all standing. As
it was&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
The speech of the old man was interrupted by a
vivid flash of lightning, followed by a distant clap of
thunder. In another moment the black water of the
lake was churned into foam, and the wind swept upon
them with the violence of a hurricane. As soon as
the storm burst forth, Barry sprang upon the porch
to assist the old admiral into the house.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said; "I'm feeling rather well this
evening. Let me face the storm awhile. Fetch me
my heavy cloak. That's well. Now pull the chair
forward where I can get it full and strong. How
good it feels! 'Tis like old times, man. Ah, if
there were only a touch of salt in the gale!"
</p>

<p>
Closely wrapped in a heavy old-fashioned boat
cloak which Barry brought him, he sat down near the
railing of the porch, threw up his old head, and drank
in the fresh gale with long breaths which brought
with them pleasant recollections. The sailor stood
on one side of the veteran, Emily on the other;
youth and strength, man and woman, at the service
of feeble age.
</p>

<p>
"See the ship!" muttered the old man; "how she
sways, yet she rides it out! Up with the helm!"
he cried, suddenly, as if she were in a seaway with
the canvas on her. "Force your head around to it,
ye old witch! Drive into it! You're good for many
a storm yet. Bless me," he added, presently, "I
forgot; yet 'tis still staunch. Ha, ha! Sound at the
heart, and will weather many a tempest yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, grandfather, what's that?" cried the girl;
"look yonder!"
</p>

<p>
She left the side of the admiral, sprang to the edge
of the porch, and pointed far out over the lake. A
little sloop, its mainsail close reefed, was beating in
toward the harbor. The twilight had so far faded in
the storm that at the distance from them the boat
then was they could scarcely distinguish more than
a slight blur of white upon the water. But, flying
toward them before the storm, she was fast rising
into view.
</p>

<p>
"Where is it, child?" asked the old man, looking
out into the growing darkness.
</p>

<p>
"There! Let your eye range across the ship;
there, beyond the Point. She's running straight upon
the sunken rocks."
</p>

<p>
"I sees it, Miss Emily," cried Barry, shading his
eyes with his hand; "'tis a yacht, the mains'l's close
reefed. She looks like a toy. There's a man in it.
He's on the port tack, thinkin' to make the harbor
without goin' about."
</p>

<p>
"He'll never do it," cried the girl, her voice shrill
with apprehension. "He can't see the sunken ledge
running out from the Point. He's a stranger to these
waters, evidently."
</p>

<p>
"I see him, too," said the admiral. "God, what a
storm! How he handles that boat! The man's a
sailor, every inch of him!"
</p>

<p>
The cutter was nearer now, so near that the man
could easily be seen. She was coming in with racing
speed in spite of her small spread of canvas. The
lake was roaring all about her and the wind threatened
to rip the mast out of the little boat, but the man
held her up to it with consummate skill, evidently expecting
to gain an entrance to the harbor, where
safety lay, on his present tack. This he could easily
have done had it not been for a long, dangerous ledge
of sunken rocks which extended out beyond Ship
House Point. Being under water, it gave little sign
of its presence to a mariner until one was right
upon it. In his excitement the admiral scrambled
to his feet, stepped to the rail of the porch, and stood
leaning over it. Presently he hollowed his hand and
shouted with a voice of astonishing power for so old a
man:
</p>

<p>
"Down with your helm, boy! Hard down!"
</p>

<p>
But the stranger, of course, could not hear him,
and the veteran stood looking with a grave frown
upon his face as that human life, down on the waters
beneath him, struggled for existence. It was not the
first time he had watched life trembling in the balance&#8212;no;
nor seen it go in the end. Emily's voice
broke in murmurs of prayer, while Barry stared like
the admiral.
</p>

<p>
Presently the man in the boat glanced up and
caught sight of the party. He was very near now
and coming on gallantly. He waved his hand, and
was astonished to see them frantically gesture back
at him. A warning! What could their movements
mean?
</p>

<p>
He peered ahead into the growing darkness; the
way seemed to be clear, yet something was evidently
wrong. What could it be? Ah! He could not
weather the Point. With a seaman's quick decision,
he jammed the helm over.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, grandfather!" screamed Emily in the old
man's ear; "can't something be done?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, child; nothing! He can't hear, he can't
see, he does not know."
</p>

<p>
"It's awful to see him rush smilingly down to
certain death!" exclaimed the girl, wringing her
hands. "Captain Barry, can't you do something?"
</p>

<p>
"There goes his helm," said the admiral; "he
realizes it at last. About he goes! Too late! too
late!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Captain Barry, you must do something!"
cried Emily.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothin' to do, Miss Emily."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is. We'll get the boat," she answered,
springing from the steps as she spoke and running
down the hill like a young fawn. The sailor instantly
followed her, and in a moment they disappeared under
the lee of the ship.

<p class="chapter">
CHAPTER V
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">The Rescue</span>
</p>


<p>
As the practised eye of the admiral had
seen, the tiny yacht was too near the
rocks to go about and escape them.
She was caught in the trough of the
sea before she had gathered way on
the other tack, and flung upon the sunken ledge,
broadside on. The mast snapped like a pipe-stem.
After a few violent shocks she was hurled over on her
beam ends, lodged securely on the rocks, and began
to break up under the beating of the angry sea.
A few moments and she would be beaten to pieces.
The man was still there, however, the water breaking
over him. He seemed to have been hurt, but clung
tenaciously to the wreck of the boat until he recovered
himself a little, and then rose slowly and stood gazing
upon the tossing waters, seething and whirling about
the wreck of his boat.
</p>

<p>
There was, during high winds, a dangerous whirlpool
right in front of the reefs and extending between
them and the smooth waters of the harbor. The
water was beating over the rocks and fairly boiling
before him. A man could not swim through it;
could, indeed, scarcely enter it and live&#8212;even a
boat would find it difficult, if not impossible. Things
looked black to the shipwrecked man. He stood
in hopeless hesitation, doom reaching for him on
either hand. He could neither go nor stay with safety.
Yet he apparently made up his mind at last to go and
die, if need be, struggling.
</p>

<p>
"Don't try the whirlpool, boy," said the admiral
softly to himself, as he looked down upon the scene.
"You could never make it in this sea. Say a prayer,
lad; 'tis all that is left you. By heaven! A noble
girl, my own child! And a brave oar, too! Steady,
Barry, steady! Don't come too near! Your skiff
can't live in such a sea. Merciful God! can they do
it?" continued the veteran, as the light skiff shot
out from the lee of the Point and, with Barry at the
oars and Emily at the helm, cautiously made its way
toward the whirlpool.
</p>

<p>
The instant they got out from the lee of the Point
the full force of the storm struck them, although they
were still within the shelter of the harbor. But they
struggled through it, for a stronger pair of arms never
pulled oars and more skilful hands than those on that
little skiff never guided a boat. Barry's strokes
were as steady and powerful as if he had been a
steam propeller, and not even the admiral himself
could have steered the boat with greater dexterity
than did the girl.
</p>

<p>
The man on the wrecked cutter saw them when the
admiral did. Evidently he was a sailor, too, for he
knew exactly what they intended to do. The two on
the boat brought the skiff as near the rocks where the
wreck of the cutter lay as they dared,&#8212;they were
almost in the whirlpool, in fact,&#8212;and then Emily, gathering
the yoke-lines in her left hand, with the other
signalled him to jump. Nodding his head, he leaped
far out over the whirling waves toward the boat. It
was his only chance.
</p>

<p>
"A gallant lad, a brave boy!" exclaimed the admiral,
as he saw the man spring from the wreck. "I
believe they'll save him yet. No, by heavens! he's
struck on one of the reefs! Is he gone? He
rises! He's in the whirlpool! He strikes out feebly;
the waves go over his head! No, he rises again!
They have him! Well done, Emily; well pulled,
Barry!"
</p>

<p>
Taking a desperate chance, the girl, seeing that the
man was practically helpless, for he was swimming
feebly and apparently scarcely able to keep his head
up, boldly sheered the boat into the whirlpool and then
turned her about. The man, retaining his self-possession,
seized the stern with his uninjured hand. Emily
leaned down and caught him by the coat collar, and
then Barry pulled his strongest to escape from the
twisting grip of the little maelstrom.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a  name="girl"><img src="images/001.jpg" alt="The girl boldly sheered the boat into the whirlpool" width="500" height="328"></a></div>
<p class="caption">The girl boldly sheered the boat into the whirlpool
</p>

<p>
Emily steered the boat with one hand and with the
other held on to the stranger. It was, of course,
impossible to get him into the boat. Presently he
fainted and hung a dead weight on her arm. The
admiral watched them, praying fervently for their success.
It was a terrible pull for the old sailor and a
terrible strain on the young woman. Again and
again she thought she would have to release the man
dragging astern. Her arm was almost jerked from
her body, yet she held on with grim determination,
steering the boat as best she could with her single
hand.
</p>

<p>
Barry pulled until the sweat beaded his forehead.
His muscles stood out like whipcords. For a few
moments he feared that he could not do it; but he
looked at the resolute figure in the stern-sheets, the
girl he loved, and that nerved his arms. Presently&#8212;and
it seemed hours to both&#8212;he got the boat out
of the whirlpool and into the comparatively smooth
water under the lee of the Point. After a few weary
strokes the keel grated upon the shore.
</p>

<p>
The sailor stepped out, made fast the painter, waded
back to where the man lay in the water, lifted him up
with the assistance of Emily, and slowly made his way
up the hill, carrying him in his arms.

<p class="chapter">
CHAPTER VI
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">The Water-Witch</span>
</p>


<p>
We have a deeper sense of proprietorship
in a thing we have earned
by hard labor or gained by the
exercise of our abilities than in
that which has been given to us,
has cost us nothing.
</p>

<p>
As Emily, walking close by Barry's side, giving him
such assistance as was possible, looked with mingled
pity and anxiety upon the white face of the man hanging
limply back over the arms of the sailor, she was
conscious that in her soul had arisen a new and curious
sense of ownership in humanity,&#8212;the most satisfactory,
yet disappointing, of our possessions. A strange
and indefinable feeling surged in her breast as she
thought hurriedly of the situation. A budding relationship&#8212;the
deep relationship of services rendered,
in fact&#8212;attached her inevitably to this stranger&#8212;if he
were yet alive.
</p>

<p>
She flushed at the feeling, as if her privacy had
been invaded, as she gazed upon him. Her thoughts
ran riot in her bosom, her soul turning toward him,
helpless, unconscious, water dripping from his torn,
sodden clothing. Perhaps he was dead or dying.
The thought gave her a sudden constriction of the
heart. That would be untoward fate surely. It
could not be.
</p>

<p>
She had saved him. The weak woman had been
strong. Her heart leaped exultingly at that. He
was hers by the divine right of service. The strange
relationship had suddenly become a fact to her. Her
arm still ached with the strain of holding him, yet
she was glad of the pain. It was the inward and
spiritual evidence of her ownership in that she had
found and brought to shore. If he would only live!
</p>

<p>
As they walked she prayed.
</p>

<p>
She was not in love with him, of course,&#8212;not yet,&#8212;and
yet she could scarcely analyze&#8212;hardly comprehend&#8212;her
feelings. Her mind was in a whirl. Faint,
exhausted physically, she did not yet see clearly.
But he was there. She had brought him. This human
bit of flotsam was hers&#8212;but for her he would have
gone down forever in the dark waters. If he lived,
what things might be? What might come? She
admitted nothing, even to herself.
</p>

<p>
It was some distance from the landing-place to
the top of the hill, and although the man they had
rescued, albeit tall, was a slender young fellow, yet
as the sailor toiled up the well-worn path he felt
the weight of the inert body growing greater with
every ascending step. Perhaps it would not have been
so had he not previously exhausted himself in the
desperate pull to gain the shore; but when at last he
reached the porch, he felt that it would have been
impossible for him to have carried his burden another
pace. Indeed, had it not been for the assistance
Emily had given him, he could not have managed it
without a stop or two for rest. But he had plunged
blindly on, something&#8212;an instinct of the future, perhaps&#8212;bidding
him rid himself without delay of the
growing oppression of his incubus. Not Sindbad had
been more anxious to throw off his old man of the
sea than he to cast down the man.
</p>

<p>
And Barry and Emily began to play at cross-purposes
from that hour.
</p>

<p>
The man saved so hardly had as yet given no sign
of life. When the three reached the porch, the sailor
laid him down at the admiral's feet and stood panting,
sweat beading on his bronzed brow. The old man, still
wrapped in his cloak, stood on the steps, careless alike
of the rising wind or the rain which had begun to fall.
</p>

<p>
"Well done!" he cried, extending his hand to
them, as the sailor deposited his burden. "I never
saw a boat better handled, girl! 'Twas a gallant
rescue, Barry!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, grandfather!" cried Emily, too anxious to
heed approval, even from such a source; "is he dead,
do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope not; but we'll soon see. Call the servants,
Emily. Barry, lift him up again and take him
into my room."
</p>

<p>
"No, mine," exclaimed Emily, as she ran to call
assistance. "I won't have you disturbed, and mine is
right off the hall here."
</p>

<p>
"Very well. Lay him on the floor, Barry. And,
Emily, bring me my flask. Bear a hand, all."
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a  name="blanket"><img src="images/002.jpg" alt="Presently the man was stretched out upon a blanket thrown upon

<p class="caption">Presently the man was stretched out upon a blanket thrown upon

</p>

<p>
Presently the man was stretched out upon a blanket
thrown upon the floor of Emily's room, and the admiral
knelt down by his side. He felt over him with
his practised fingers, murmuring the while:
</p>

<p>
"No bones broken apparently. I guess he'll be
all right. Have you the flask there, daughter? This
will bring him around, I trust," he added, as he
poured the restoring liquid down the man's throat.
"Barry, go you for Dr. Wilcox as quick as you
can. Present my compliments to him, and ask him
to come here at once. Shake a leg, man! Emily,
loosen the man's collar&#8212;your fingers are younger
than mine&#8212;and give him another swallow. He's
worth a dozen dead men yet, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the admiral rose to his feet and gave
place to Emily. Very gently the girl did as the old
man bade her, and presently the man extended before
her opened his eyes and stared up at her vacantly,
wonderingly, for a few moments at first, and then, with
a dawning light of recognition in his eyes, he smiled
faintly as he remembered. His first words might have
been considered flippant, unworthy of the situation,
but to the girl they seemed not inappropriate.
</p>

<p>
"The blue-eyed water-witch!" he murmured.
"To be saved by you," he continued, half jestingly,&#8212;it
was a brave heart which could find place for pleasantry
then, she thought,&#8212;"and then to find you
smiling above me."
</p>

<p>
At these whispered words what he still lacked in
color flickered into Emily's face, and as he gazed
steadily upon her, the flicker became a flame which
suffused her cheeks. He had noticed her even in
those death-fronting moments on the wreck.
</p>

<p>
"Are you better now?" she asked him in her confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Better, miss?" he answered, softly, yet not
striving to rise; "I am well again. I came down
to&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, lad, silence fore and aft! Belay all until
the surgeon comes, and you shall tell us all about it
then," interrupted the admiral. "He'll be here in a
moment now, I think, if Barry have good luck. Will
you have another swallow of whiskey?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, thank you; I've had enough."
</p>

<p>
At that moment the sailor entered the hall, fairly
dragging the fat little doctor in his wake.
</p>

<p>
"I fell foul of him just outside of the yard, your
honor," said Barry, as he appeared in the door-way.
</p>

<p>
"'Fell foul of me!' I should think you did! You
fell on me like a storm," cried the doctor, dropping
his wet cloak in the passage-way and bustling into
the room. "What is it, admiral? Are you&#8212;&#8212;?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right, doctor."
</p>

<p>
"It's not Miss Emily?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; I'm all right, too; but&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Oho!" said the doctor, his glance at last falling
to the man extended on the floor; "this is the
patient, is it? Well, young man, you look rather
damp, I am sure. What's up?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing seems to be up, sir," answered the man,
smilingly, amusedly. "I seem to be down, though."
</p>

<p>
"I guess you're in pretty good shape, sir," said
the doctor, laughingly, "if you can joke about it; and
if you are down now, we'll soon have you up."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, the physician knelt and examined
his patient carefully.
</p>

<p>
"How did it happen, Miss Emily?" he asked, as
he proceeded with his investigations.
</p>

<p>
"Why, doctor, we picked him up out of the
water."
</p>

<p>
"We?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir. Captain Barry and I."
</p>

<p>
"My sloop was wrecked on the rocks beyond the
old ship," said the young man; "and when this
young lady came along in a boat I jumped, and as
I am not quite recovered from a wound I got at
Mobile Bay, I suppose I lost consciousness from the
shock. I'm all right now, though."
</p>

<p>
"I think so, too," said the doctor; "we'll get these
wet clothes off you in a jiffy, and then I'll give you
something, and in the morning you'll hardly know
you've been in danger."
</p>

<p>
"I shall never forget that I was in danger this
time, sir," said the young man, addressing the doctor,
but looking fixedly at the young girl.
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not; but why particularly at this
time?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I was saved by&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's it, is it? Faith, I'd be willing to be
half drowned myself to be saved in that way. Meanwhile,
do you withdraw, Miss Emily, and we'll get
him ready for bed. Where is he to lie?"
</p>

<p>
"Here," said the girl.
</p>

<p>
"In your room?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"I protest, sir," said the man, sitting up with astonishing
access of vigor.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody protests when Miss Emily commands
anything. Here you'll stay, sir!" said Barry, gruffly,
as the girl left the room.
</p>

<p>
The doctor and the sailor soon tucked him away in
bed, the admiral looking on. As they undressed him
they noticed a long scar across his breast where a shell
from Fort Morgan had keeled him over. The doctor
examined it critically.
</p>

<p>
"That was a bad one," he said, touching the
wound deftly with his pudgy yet knowing finger.
"That'll be the one you spoke of, I take it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," answered the young man; "it's been a
long time in healing. I feel the effect of it yet sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"But you'll get over it in time, young man, I'm
thinking," said the kindly little country doctor.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, sir."
</p>

<p>
The patient was thin and pale from the effects of
the wound, which, as he said, had been a long time
healing. It was evident that he had not yet recovered
his strength or his weight, either, or the burden
on Captain Barry would have been heavier than it
was.
</p>

<p>
"Did you say," said the admiral, as they prepared
to leave him, "that you had been at Mobile Bay?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What ship were you on?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Hartford</i>, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Bless me!" exclaimed the old man; "with Dave
Farragut?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; I had that honor."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I knew that boy when he was a midshipman.
I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, admiral, excuse me for giving commands in
your presence, but you know there are times when the
doctor rules the ship. This young man must be left
alone, and, after the excitement, I think you had
better go to bed&#8212;excuse me, I mean turn in&#8212;yourself,"
interposed the physician, peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
"Hark to the storm!" said the old man, turning to
the window, his thoughts diverted for the moment
from the accident and his guest&#8212;it needed but
little to turn his mind to the ship at any time or under
any circumstances. "Mark the flash of the lightning,
hear the thunder, doctor! She'll be sore racked to-night!"
</p>

<p>
He peered anxiously out into the darkness over the
Point.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, admiral."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, sir. I must wait for another flash to see
whether the old ship still stands. Ay, there she is!
Well, 'twill not be long; and were it not for Emily,
I'd say, thank God! Good-night, lad. A boy with
Farragut, and he a boy with me! Well, well! Good-night;
sleep well, sir."
</p>

<p>
Long time the veteran lay awake listening to the
wind and waiting for the crash of the ship. And in
the room above, where the servants had made a bed
for Emily, another kept sleepless watch, though she
thought but little of the storm; or, if she did, it was
with thankfulness for what it had brought her.
</p>

<p>
How handsome he had looked, even with that
death-like pallor upon his brown sunburnt cheek, as
she had knelt beside him! Had the waves of the
tempest indeed brought the long-expected, long-dreamed-of
lover to her feet? And he was a sailor;
he had been with Farragut; he had been wounded in
the service of his country&#8212;a hero! And what had
he said? "Saved by a blue-eyed water-witch!" How
delightful to think on! And he would never forget
the rescue because she had done it! He jested, surely;
yet could the words be true?
</p>

<p>
How different he was from the young men of the
village! Even the few officers of the different detachments
of volunteers which had successively garrisoned
the fort were not as he. How different from Captain
Barry, too&#8212;alas, poor old sailor! Her grandfather,
now, might have been like him when he was younger.
</p>

<p>
What a storm it was! How the wind howled
around the corners of the house! What had he come
there for? Strangers rarely visited the quiet little
town. What business or pleasure had brought him to
the village? Was the ship braving the storm? If
the ship went down, her grandfather would go, too,
and perhaps Captain Barry. Who would care for her
then? What was that young man's name? Pity he
had not mentioned it. "A blue-eyed water-witch!"
</p>

<p>
She drifted off to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Down upon the deck of the old ship, heedless of
the storm, Captain Barry paced restlessly up and
down. What had he done it for? What fool's impulse
had made him obey her sharp command?
'Twas his arm that had held the boat under iron
control; 'twas his powerful stroke that had brought it
near enough to enable the man to make the leap with
the chance of safety; and he had carried him up the
hill. The increasing weight of the incumbrance but
typified the growing heaviness of his heart. The
man was one of the admiral's class,&#8212;a gentleman, an
officer, a man who had been wounded in the service
of his country, a hero. How he had stared at Emily
when his senses came back to him! He, Barry, was
only a common sailor, a blue-jacket, the admiral's
servitor, Miss Emily's dog, old enough to be her
father,&#8212;a fool!
</p>

<p>
He stood up in the darkness and stretched out his
arms to heaven,&#8212;what voiceless, wordless prayer in
his lonely old heart? The storm beat full upon him.
His mind was filled with foreboding, regret, jealousy,
anguish. Why had the man come there? Was it for
Emily? What should any man come there for if not
for her?
</p>

<p>
But, stay; he was a sailor. Perhaps he had come
for the ship! The war was over, retrenchment the
cry. Poor Barry had heard strange rumors. There
was no sleep for him that night.

CHAPTER VII
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">The Home of the Sea-Maiden</span>
</p>


<p>
Mr. Richard Revere was a young
lieutenant in the navy of the United
States. He came of an ancient and
honorable family, possessed of wealth
and station. He had graduated from
the Naval Academy in 1863, and, by an act of daring
gallantry in cutting out a blockade-runner, had easily
won a lieutenant's commission. When Farragut sailed
into Mobile Bay on that hot August morning in
1864, the young man stood on the deck by his side.
A Blakely shell from Fort Morgan had seriously
wounded him, and this wound, coupled with a long
siege of fever subsequently, had almost done for him.
</p>

<p>
Although over a year had elapsed since that eventful
day, he had by no means regained his strength,
although he seemed now on the fair road to recovery.
Anxious to be on duty again after this long period of
enforced idleness, he had recently applied for orders,
and had been detailed to proceed to Lake Ontario
and make arrangements for the sale, or other disposal,
of the <i>Susquehanna</i>. His mother owned a cottage
on one of the Thousand Isles, and the distance was,
therefore, inconsiderable. When the orders had
reached him there, he determined to sail down to
Sewell's Harbor in a little yacht which he had chartered
for lake cruising, instead of taking the longer
and more tedious journey by land.
</p>

<p>
He had reached his destination in the way which
has been told. It was imprudent in him to have
attempted to make the mouth of an unknown harbor
in such a storm, and he had nearly paid the penalty
for his folly with his life. Exhausted by his adventure,
he fell speedily into a sound and refreshing slumber,
his last thought being of the radiant face bowed
over him when he had opened his eyes in the very
room in which he now sought rest.
</p>

<p>
He awoke in the morning feeling very much better.
On a chair opposite the bed lay a suit of clothes. He
glanced at the garments curiously and observed that
they were the different articles of a blue-jacket's uniform.
They evidently belonged to that sailor-man
who had assisted in his rescue. They were new and
spotlessly neat; certainly his best suit. His own uniform
was nowhere to be seen. It must have been
badly torn and, of course, thoroughly soaked by his
adventure. His clothes, probably, were not yet fit to
put on. If he were to get up at all he must make use
of these. Well, it would not be the first time that he
had worn a seaman's clothes. They reminded him of
his cadet days, and so he arose, somewhat painfully be
it known, and dressed himself, curiously surveying the
room as he did so.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange room, he thought, for a young
girl, as he remembered that it belonged to her. Her?
How indefinite that was! He wished he knew her
name. He wondered whether it were beautiful enough
to be appropriate. He hoped so. The chamber was
not at all like that of a young woman. For instance,
there was a deadly looking harpoon standing in the
corner. He picked up the sinister weapon and examined
it.
</p>

<p>
"Queer toy, that thing, for a girl," he murmured;
"quite a proper weapon for a whaler, though."
</p>

<p>
Its barbs were as sharp and keen as a razor. On
the wooden staff the letters "J. B." were roughly
carved. Were those her initials? Pshaw, of course
not! But whose? He experienced quite a thrill
of&#8212;it could not be jealousy! That was absurd.
</p>

<p>
"What's this? A model of a ship. By Jove! I
believe it's the old <i>Susquehanna</i> herself,&#8212;the ship I
am come to sell! And here's a shark's tooth rudely
carved. Oars in the other corner, too. And a fish-net
and lines! This bunch of wild flowers, though,
and the contents of this bureau mark the woman;
but I'm blessed if there isn't a boatswain's call, laniard
and all! That's about the prettiest laniard I
ever saw," he continued, critically examining the
knots and strands and Turk's heads. "Have I
stumbled into Master Jack's quarters by mistake, or&#8212;oh,
I see how it is. I suppose that old sailor has
loaded her with these treasures. He probably adores
her&#8212;who could help it? And the admiral, too.
Now, what's this, I wonder? What a queer-looking
sword!"
</p>

<p>
He lifted up the weapon, which lay on a wooden
shelf between the windows, crossed pistols of ancient
make hanging above it beneath a fine old painting
of a handsome young naval officer, in the uniform of
a captain of the 1812 period. The leather scabbard
was richly and artistically mounted in silver, but
the hilt was a rough piece of unpolished, hammered
iron. He drew the weapon from the sheath. The
blade was of the most exquisite quality, beautifully
chased, a rare bit of Toledo steel, handsome enough
to throw a connoisseur into ecstasy. He tested it,
cautiously at first, and then boldly; it was a magnificent
weapon, tempered to perfection. Such a blade
as a king or conqueror might have wielded,&#8212;and
yet, that coarse iron hilt! What could it mean?
He thrust it back reverently into its scabbard and
laid it down, and then completed his toilet.
</p>

<p>
When he was dressed, he took a long look at himself
in the little, old-fashioned mirror swinging between
two lyre-shaped standards on the dresser, and
smiled at the picture. In height he was, perhaps,
as tall as the sailor, but in bulk there was no comparison.
He laughed at the way the clothes hung
about him. Yet the dashing, jaunty uniform was
not ill adapted to set off his handsome face. It was
complete, even to sheath-knife and belt. On the
chair lay the flat cap, bearing on its ribbon, in letters
of gold, the name <i>Susquehanna</i>. He put the cap
on and went out on the porch.
</p>

<p>
Captain Barry was standing at the foot of the steps
leading from the porch, looking at the ship. It was
early morning.
</p>

<p>
"My man," said the young officer, meaning to be
entirely friendly and cordial, as he was profoundly
grateful, yet unable entirely to keep the difference of
rank and station out of his voice and manner,&#8212;a
condescension which irritated the sailor beyond expression.
They were both dressed exactly alike,
and certainly physically the older was the better
man. He had lived long enough in the society of
the girl and the old man to have developed some
of the finer feelings of his nature, too. He shook
himself angrily, therefore, as the other spoke.
</p>

<p>
"My man, you lay me under double obligation.
You and your golden-haired mistress presented me
with my life last night, and now you 'paint the lily'&#8212;gad,
that's a good simile, isn't it?" he chuckled to
himself&#8212;"by giving me your clothes. How am I to
acquit myself of all I owe you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said the old man, grimly, knuckling his
forehead, with a sea-scrape of his foot, more as a matter
of habit than as a token of respect, "you owe me
nothing."
</p>

<p>
He turned abruptly, and went around the house
without looking back.
</p>

<p>
"Queer duck, that," soliloquized the young man,
staring after him in amazement; "seems to be mad
about something. Mad at me, perhaps. I wonder
why? Well, those old shellbacks are apt to take
quaint notions. Never mind; let him do what he
likes. Where would you be, Mr. Dick Revere, if it
had not been for him and the girl? How funny I
must look, though! I wonder whether the apparel
becomes the man? I flatter myself I have given the
proper hitch to the tie. It is 'a touch of wild civility
that doth bewitch me,'" he quoted. "I wish I had
brought that bo's'n's whistle out. I'd like to sound
a call or two."
</p>

<p>
He drifted off into a brown study, thinking hard
in this manner.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what Josephine would say if she could
see me now? Is all our difference of rank but a
matter of uniform? By Jove! I forgot all about her.
I don't believe I've thought of her since I left them;
yet, if the novels are right, I should have been thinking
of her when I stood on the deck of the yacht
expecting every moment would be my last. I was
thinking of that girl in the boat, though. Wasn't
she splendid? Plucky, pretty&#8212;well! Gracious me,
Richard Revere, at the age of twenty-four you are
surely not going to fall in love with the first woman
you see, especially since you have been engaged to
Josephine Remington pretty much ever since you
were born,&#8212;or ever since she was born, which was
four years later. But I swear I'd give a year of
Josephine's cold, classic, beautiful regularity for a
minute of&#8212;pshaw, don't be a fool! I'll go and look at
the yacht. I wonder whether anything's left of her?
Nobody would think there had been a storm of any kind
to look at the lake to-day. What a lovely morning!"
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the wind had gone down to a gentle breeze,
and the surface of the lake was tossing in thousands
of merry little waves, their white crests sparkling in
the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
"The old ship is still standing," he continued,
soliloquizing again, as he walked toward the bluff.
"I suppose it will come awfully hard on the old man
when he finds out that the government is going to sell
her. What did they tell me his name was? Somebody
or other distinguished; I forget who. Must have been
a fine old chap in his day. What was it he said when
he looked out of the window before he bade me good-night?
This is going to be rather a tough sort of a
job, I'm afraid, and I don't half like it."
</p>

<p>
He had reached the hill by this time, and, feeling
a little tired, he sat down on the steps overlooking
the sea. There, below him on the Point, stood the
ship-of-the-line. An imposing picture, indeed. He
had been too busy the night before to notice it. He
stared at it with growing interest, and a feeling of
pity, for whom, for what, he could scarcely say,
slowly rose in his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old ship!" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
A ragged mass of fallen timber on the lee side proclaimed
that some portion of her had been carried away
during the storm of the night,&#8212;and she had little left
to spare. There, too, on the reef beyond, were the
remains of the <i>Josephine</i>, battered into a shapeless ruin.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that was a close shave; the <i>Josephine</i> will
never carry sail again. What melancholy pictures!"
he said, thoughtfully; "poor little boat, too! I've
had many a good time on her, and now I&#8212;But
I'd cheerfully give a dozen yachts," he continued,
with the reckless hyperbole of youth, "to be rescued
by&#8212;&#8212;"

</p>


<p>
The continuity of his thought was
suddenly broken. A beautiful hand,
of exquisite touch, sunburned, but
shapely, delicate, but strong, was laid
lightly on his shoulder. He glanced
down at it, thrilled!
</p>

<p>
"Captain Barry," exclaimed a fresh, clear young
voice, which in perfection matched the hand, "have
you looked to the comfort of our guest? Oh, sir,
I beg your pardon. I thought&#8212;&#8212;" she cried in
dismay, as Revere rose to his feet and bowed low
before her.
</p>

<p>
"May I answer your question? He has, as these
clothes, which account for your mistake, will witness."
</p>

<p>
"And are you well, sir? Are you none the worse
for&#8212;&#8212;?"
</p>

<p>
"Much the better, I should say," answered the
young man, "since my adventure has gained me the
privilege of your acquaintance."
</p>

<p>
"You might have had that without risking your life,
sir," she responded, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Not without risking my heart, I am sure," he replied,
gallantly.
</p>

<p>
"What a strange way you have of addressing
people!" she continued, looking at him so frankly and
so innocently that he felt ashamed of himself. "Do
you always talk in that way?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, not always," he replied, laughing; "but I
jest&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was only a jest, then," she interrupted, her
heart sinking faintly.
</p>

<p>
"But I jest when I should be thanking you for
giving me my life," he continued, disregarding her
interruption. "You saved my life, Miss&#8212;I do
not know your name."
</p>

<p>
"I am Emily Sanford, the admiral's granddaughter."
</p>

<p>
"You saved my life, Miss Sanford."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe I've ever been called 'Miss Sanford'
in my life. How strange it sounds!" she exclaimed,
na&#239;vely. "Everybody here calls me 'Miss
Emily.'"
</p>

<p>
"You will not find me unwilling, I am sure, to
adopt the common practice," he exclaimed, lightly.
"But, seriously, death never seemed nearer to me
than it did last night, and I have been near it before,
too. Had it not been for you&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"And Captain Barry," she interrupted, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, for him, too, I'd not be here thanking
you now."
</p>

<p>
"But it was nothing, after all; anybody could have
done it."
</p>

<p>
"There I disagree with you. I am sailor enough
to know that it was a most desperate undertaking.
You put your own life in hazard to save mine. If
that old man had relaxed his efforts, if you had made
a mistake with those yoke-lines,&#8212;well, there would
have been three of us to go instead of one."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hardly that."
</p>

<p>
"But I know, Miss Emily, and I cannot allow
you to disparage your action so. 'Twas a most
heroic thing, and I'm not worthy the risk and the
effort."
</p>

<p>
"But you have been with Farragut; you were at
Mobile Bay in the <i>Hartford</i>; you&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"You did not know it then, surely?" in great
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I did not then; but since I did&#8212;as you persist in
saying&#8212;save you, I am glad to know it now. But
you have not told me your name."
</p>

<p>
"My name is Richard Revere. I am a lieutenant
in the United States navy."
</p>

<p>
"How did you happen to come here?" curiously.
</p>

<p>
"I came about the ship."
</p>

<p>
"The ship?" she cried in alarm. "What of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I came to inspect it," he answered, evasively,
something prompting him that he was getting in dangerous
waters.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she exclaimed, greatly relieved; "I thought
you might have come to destroy it, or to dispose of it.
You see, it would be the death of grandfather if anything
should happen to the old ship, and it would kill
the old sailor, too; and then what would become of
me?"
</p>

<p>
Her frankness delighted him. An answer trembled
on the tip of his tongue, but by a great effort he restrained
his inclination and questioned her.
</p>

<p>
"Have you no relatives, no friends?"
</p>

<p>
"No relatives at all except grandfather," she answered,
freely and frankly. "I have lived here since
I was a baby with the admiral and Captain Barry.
My mother died when I was an infant, and she was the
only child of her mother. I haven't a connection in
the world that I know of. Friends? Yes, everybody
in the village is a friend of mine; but they are different,
you know. I wonder sometimes what will happen
when&#8212;they can't last much longer, you know, but
God will take care of me," she continued, simply.
</p>

<p>
"And I, too," he murmured softly, in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
"You!" she cried, surprised, turning her clear,
splendid eyes toward him and confronting him in one
unabashed glance. "What do you mean? I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Miss Emily," he answered, recovering
himself again; "you are right. God will find some
way, I doubt not. I only mean to say that if you ever
need a friend, a real friend, you may count upon me
and upon my mother. She owes you a son, you
know, and I am sure she would gladly pay her debt
in kindness to you."
</p>

<p>
Dangerous promises, Richard, so far as you are concerned,
in spite of Plato; and few men there be who
dare assume to speak for a woman, a mother, to a
possible daughter-in-law!
</p>

<p>
His words were simple enough, but there was such
intensity in the glance that accompanied them that
the girl, innocent though she was, shrank from it,&#8212;not
with fear, but from the old, old instinct of woman
that suggests flight when fain to be pursued.
</p>

<p>
"More of the ship went with the gale last night,"
she murmured, pointing; "see yonder. I think every
gale that comes will be the last of her. Your boat is
gone to pieces, too."
</p>

<p>
"I count it well lost," he replied, softly, "for it has
brought me to you."
</p>

<p>
"You must not say that," she answered, gravely;
"and I am forgetting my duty. Breakfast is nearly
ready. I came to tell you. Will you come into the
house?"
</p>

<p>
It was not the first time that a maiden forgot her
duty&#8212;even in trifles like this&#8212;in the presence of a
man she was beginning to love, nor would it be the
last.
</p>

<p>
"Did you, then, do me the honor to seek me? I
am delighted."
</p>

<p>
"At the prospect of breakfast?" she asked, smiling
at him merrily.
</p>

<p>
"Of course. Did you ever see a sailor-man who
wasn't?"
</p>

<p>
"The only sailor-men I know are my grandfather
and Captain Barry. Grandfather cares nothing about
it, but I must say that Captain Barry&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Does full justice to his rations, I doubt not. He
looks like it. Well, I am only a lieutenant. I will
follow the captain. May I help you up the hill?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed lightly at him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Revere, I run up and down that hill a
dozen times a day, and I should think, after your
battering of last night, you would rather depend upon
me. Come, let us go."
</p>

<p>
They had gone but a few steps when an idea
struck the lieutenant. He stopped, pressed his hand
against his side, and gazed beseechingly at his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what is it?" she cried; "your wound? You
ought not to have come out. What shall we do?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid," answered this mendacious deceiver;
"I am sorry to trouble you, but I will have to be
helped up the hill, after all. You see&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, of course. How thoughtless of me!
I'll call Captain Barry at once."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; that will be unnecessary. If you will
give me your hand I think I can manage."
</p>

<p>
She extended her hand to him instantly with all the
freedom of her character, and her ready offer shamed
him again. His repentance of his subterfuge did not
rise to the renunciation point, for it must be confessed
that he seized the beautiful, sunburnt little hand with
avidity, and clung to it as if he really craved assistance.
She helped him religiously up the hill, and,
as he showed no desire to relinquish her hand when
they reached the top, she asked him if he did not feel
able to walk alone now; and when he was forced to
reply in the affirmative, she drew it gently away.
</p>

<p>
"You see," he said, "it was so delightful, I quite
forgot."
</p>

<p>
"What was delightful?"
</p>

<p>
"To have reached the top of the hill; you know it
was so pleasant, I&#8212;I&#8212;forgot&#8212;I was holding your
hand."
</p>

<p>
If Emily had been a modern young woman she
might have asked him how he could ever have forgotten
for a moment that he was holding her hand;
but as his glance carried his meaning home to her she
flushed deeply. The admiral's voice calling to them
from the door-way put an end to a scene which was
delightful to both of them.
</p>

<p>
On seeing the old man, the young man took off his
cap and bowed respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," he said, "my name is Richard Revere."
</p>

<p>
"Are you related to Commodore Dick Revere of
the old navy?"
</p>

<p>
"He was my grandfather, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I knew him well; I sailed on many a cruise with
him. A gallant fellow, a loyal friend. I'm glad to
meet you, sir. You are welcome."
</p>

<p>
"I have to thank you for your hospitality, sir, even
as I thank your granddaughter for her heroic rescue
of me last night."
</p>

<p>
"It was, indeed, nobly done, young sir, and I am
glad that my child should have been of service to a
grandson of Dick Revere, or to a friend of Dave
Farragut. You were at Mobile, were you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, and on the <i>Hartford</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I've seen many a battle in my day, young sir,"
said the old admiral, simply. "It was old-fashioned
fighting then, yard-arm to yard-arm, but we went at
it good and hard, and our hearts were in it, I doubt
not, just as yours were."
</p>

<p>
"May I know your name, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I am called Charles Stewart," responded the other.
</p>

<p>
"What?" cried the lieutenant. "Charles Stewart
of the <i>Constitution</i>? The man who took the <i>Cyane</i>
and the <i>Levant</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"The same, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Him they call 'Old Ironsides'?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe my countrymen do apply that name to
me sometimes," replied the old man, smiling with
pleasure at the hearty admiration of the younger.
</p>

<p>
"I am proud to know you, sir, and proud to see
you. We of the new navy only hope that we may
live up to the record you of the old made in the
past, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You have more than done that," said the old man,
heartily; "we had no better men than Farragut and
young Porter. I sailed with old Porter, his father,
many a time. I knew him well."
</p>

<p>
"But come, grandfather," said Emily, "breakfast is
ready."
</p>

<p>
"A moment, child," said the old man, forgetting
for the moment, apparently, his environment. "I
must look at the ship. Good-morning, Barry," he
continued, as the sailor approached him; "is it well
with the ship?"
</p>

<p>
"A good piece of it went down last night, your
honor, I'm sorry to say. It lies off on the port side,
yonder, under the lee, but nothin' vital yet, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I did not think to see it this morning. Bit by bit
it wears away. Well, please God, there will be an end
some day."
</p>

CHAPTER IX
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">The Sword of the Constitution</span>
</p>


<p>
Clothed in his own uniform, but hardly
in his right mind, Mr. Richard Revere
sat down late in the afternoon to consider
the situation.
</p>

<p>
He had passed a delightfully idle day
in the society of the admiral and his granddaughter;
principally, it must be confessed, and in so far as he
could contrive it, with the latter. Her cunning fingers
had mended the rents in his uniform, which had been
dried and put into a passably wearable condition.
The versatility of her education and the variety of
her accomplishments were evidenced to him when he
saw that she wielded the needle as deftly as she
steered the boat.
</p>

<p>
They had sat on the porch most of the time in the
pleasant fall weather, and the dozing old admiral
offered but little check to the freedom of their intercourse.
In response to her insistent questioning, this
young Telemachus, cast up by the sea at her feet,
poured into the ear of this new Calypso stories of the
naval battles in which he had participated and whose
honorable scars he bore. Like Desdemona, she loved
him for the dangers he had passed.
</p>

<p>
She was familiar with the history of the old navy,
of which the admiral had been one of the brightest
stars. Many a tale had the old man told her of storm
and tempest, battle and triumph, shipwreck and disaster,
and his own adventures and distinguished career
she knew by heart. Although the great wave of the
Civil War had ebbed and flowed far to the south of
them, she and her grandfather had prayerfully and
anxiously followed its mighty course, especially on the
sea; yet it so happened that this was the first time
that either of them had been brought in personal contact
with its naval side. A returning volunteer, a
wounded soldier,&#8212;for the little town had done its
patriotic part with the rest,&#8212;had sometimes brought
fresher news of the battles than might be read in the
papers, but no sailor had come to tell them how
Farragut had damned the torpedoes and steamed
through the pass until Revere told the thrilling story
of the immortal fight.
</p>

<p>
The admiral waked up while this was being recounted,
and he pressed the young man with the keen
questions of a veteran who knew well the sound of
battle and had fronted the enemy undismayed. Even
the story of the wound that disabled Revere must be
told, in spite of his reluctance to mention it, and
Emily dropped the needle and listened with bated
breath to the simple and modest recital.
</p>

<p>
"Were you ever wounded, admiral?" questioned
the young sailor, when he had finished his story.
</p>

<p>
"Never, by God's providence," said the old man;
"though I came near to it once."
</p>

<p>
"And how was that, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, when the old <i>Constitution</i> took the <i>Cyane</i>
and the <i>Levant</i>, a shot from the <i>Cyane</i> struck the hilt of
my sword, carried it away, and slewed me about so that
I thought for a moment that I had been hit in the side.
It was a Spanish blade, and I prized it highly. I was
lucky enough to give some succor to a Spanish brig in
distress down in the West Indies on a certain occasion,
years before, and His Most Catholic Majesty of Spain
was pleased to present me with a sword for it, a beautiful
Toledo blade, the finest sword I ever saw. It
was richly hilted and scabbarded, as became such a
weapon, and I always wore it in action. Of course,
the hilt was ruined by the shot, and the armorer of
the <i>Constitution</i> made a rude guard out of a piece of
iron he took from the <i>Levant</i> after she struck, to replace
the broken hilt, and I've never cared to change
it since."
</p>

<p>
"I saw it this morning in Miss Emily's room," said
Revere. "I took the liberty of examining it, and I
was struck by the beauty of the blade and the roughness
of the hilt. I quite agree with you, sir. I should
not have it changed for anything."
</p>

<p>
"I call it the sword of the <i>Constitution</i>," said Emily.
</p>

<p>
"How comes it in your room, may I ask, Miss
Emily?"
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather gave it to me. I am the only son of
the house, you see," she continued with a melancholy
sigh. "I would that I had been a man."
</p>

<p>
"That is a wish in which I cannot join you," said
the young officer, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's a pity," responded the girl, "that so
great and gallant a sailor as my grandfather should
leave no one to bear his name."
</p>

<p>
"My dear young lady, his name is borne in our history
and upon our hearts," answered Revere, quickly.
"The world will never forget '<i>Old Ironsides</i>' and her
last great fighting captain. The new navy is the
child of the old, and, in a certain sense, we all feel
the obligations of such distinguished ancestry. As
for me, that I have been permitted to meet you, sir,"
he said, turning to the admiral, "in this intimate and
familiar way, is one of the proudest moments of my
life."
</p>

<p>
"Is it so?" said the old man, simply; "we only did
our duty then, just as you are doing it now. Dave
Farragut, now, he was trained in our school&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"And we are trained in his school; so you see here
is a connection. Some day we may show what we
have learned from him, as he showed what he had
learned from you."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it not, young sir, I doubt it not; and
while I have no sons or grandsons to bear my name,
yet Emily is a good child. No one could wish for a
better daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Of that I am quite sure," interrupted the lieutenant,
spontaneously.
</p>

<p>
"And, perhaps," continued the admiral, simply,
"in the hands of her children the sword of the <i>Constitution</i>
may again be drawn in the service of our
beloved country. But where is Barry? The sun
is just setting. He should&#8212;Ah, there he is.
Evening colors, Mr. Revere," said the veteran, rising
to his feet as the gun on the terrace boomed out in
salute, and standing still until the colors slowly and
gracefully floated down.
</p>

<p>
One of the most beautiful of sights is the fall of
a flag, when it comes down by your own hand and
betokens no surrender. The declining banner lingers
in the evening air with sweet reluctance until it finally
drops into waiting hands with a touch like a caress.
</p>

<p>
"You see, we keep up the customs of the service
as near as we can, sir. How is the ship, Barry?" the
admiral asked, as the old sailor delivered his report,
as he had done the evening before and on all
the evenings of their long sojourn on Ship House
Point.
</p>

<p>
"I have a fond fancy, Mr. Revere," resumed the
veteran, after the termination of the customary conversation
with the sailor, "that the ship and I will
sail into the final harbor together. Both of us are
old and worn out, laid up in ordinary, waiting for the
end. But let us go into the house. The night air
grows chill for me. Emily shall sing to us, and then
I shall bid you good-night."
</p>

<p>
The girl's sweet, low voice, although unaccompanied,
makes rare music in the old room. The admiral
sits with his eyes closed, a smile upon his lips,
beating the time upon the arm of his chair with his
withered fingers. The songs the girl sings are of
the music of the past; the words, those the admiral
heard when he was a boy. Now it is a rollicking
sea-chorus which bubbles from her young lips, now
it is a sweet old ballad that his wife sang in the long
ago time. His head nods, and he says, softly, under
his breath, half in time with the rhythm,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Ay, just so. When I was a boy, so many years
ago!"
</p>

<p>
Revere listens entranced, though possibly he had
arrived at such a state that he would have listened
entranced if she had sung badly,&#8212;which she did not.
Her voice, though untrained, was delightful. It had
the naturalness of bird notes, the freshness of youth,
and the purity that charms the world. The airs were
half-forgotten things, lingering familiarly in his memory.
He may have heard them when he was a baby
in his mother's arms, and she from her mother, and
so on down through the long line of ancient ancestry
maternal.
</p>

<p>
The sweetest songs, are they not the oldest? Have
not the peasants of Sicily been singing the music of
"Home, Sweet Home," for a thousand years?
</p>

<p>
And so the young man listens and loves, the old
man listens and dreams, and the girl sings as never
before, for this time she knows that a young heart beats
in harmony with her voice. Alas for the old! he has
had his day. Compelling youth enters and displaces
him. Emily sings not merely for the past, but with
thoughts reaching out into the future. When she
stops, fain to be persuaded, Revere entreats her to continue,
he begs for more. She knows not how to refuse,
indeed does not wish to do so, so she sings on and on.
</p>

<p>
The admiral sleeps, but what of that? Youth
listens, and by and by, as she strikes something that
he knows, in a fresh, hearty tenor voice he ventures
to join with her. In the harmony of their voices
they almost see a prophecy of the future harmony
of their lives.
</p>

<p>
Many a time has she sung to the admiral and the
old sailor, but never quite as to-night. And Captain
Barry has not been there. The heavy oaken
chair, which he made himself from the timbers of the
ship, which stands by the door, and which, in its rude
strength, its severe plainness, somehow suggests the
man, is empty. To the admiral she has sung like a
voice from the past, to Barry her music has been like
that of an angel in heaven, to Revere it is the voice
of the woman he loves. But to-night, although he
hears the music, Captain Barry will not come in. He
stands on the porch, peering through the blinds.
Unskilled as he is in the reading of character, unaccustomed
to the observation of faces, there is no
mistaking, even in the sailor's mind, the look in the
eyes of Revere.
</p>

<p>
The young man sits opposite Emily, listening to
her, watching her, drinking in the sweetness of the
melody and the beauty of her face; the light that is
in his eye is the light of a love that has come, not as
the oak grows from the tiny seed, slowly developing
through the ages, and spreading and bourgeoning until
it fills the landscape, but the glory of a passion that has
burst upon him with the suddenness of a tempest, and
one that promises to be as irresistible in its onset. And
Barry sees it all, divines, knows, feels, and in the light
of another love recognizes at last his own futile passion. The revelation of hopelessness in the light of
hope, of despair in the glow of success.
</p>

<p>
Never had the Bostonian been brought in contact
with a personality quite like that of Emily. More
beautiful girls, measured by the canons, he had seen,
possibly; wiser in the world's ways, better trained,
more accustomed to the usages of society, undoubtedly;
but never one so sweet, so innocent, so fresh, so
unspoiled, so lovely, and so lovable. As frank as she
was beautiful, as brave as she was innocent, as pure
as she was strong. There was no use denying it; he
could not disguise it; he had loved her from the moment
when, standing on the wreck, he saw her steering
the skiff in the storm, with her fair hair blown out
by the breeze and her face turned up toward him, full
of encouragement and entreaty.
</p>

<p>
And Barry knew it now.
</p>

<p>
As a young sailor, Revere had flirted and frolicked
with many girls, he had been staidly engaged to another
for a long time, but not until that day had he
really loved any one. As for the girl, she had taken
him at his face value; and while it would hardly be
just to say that she entirely reciprocated his feeling,
yet it was easy to see whither her heart tended and
what the end of the acquaintance would be unless
something checked the course of the growing interest
she felt in the young man.
</p>

<p>
Could Barry check it? He yearned to try. And
all these things were plain to the old sailor. He suddenly
found himself dowered with an unwonted
ability to reason, to see, to read beneath the surface.
'Twas love's enlightening touch; hopeless, uncoveting,
yet jealous love, that opened his eyes. Love
blinds? Ay, but he enlightens, too.
</p>

<p>
Barry's glance through the window ranged from
the dozing admiral to the adoring young man, and
paused over the face, exalted, of the young woman.
His breath came hard as he gazed, his heart rose in
his throat and tried to suffocate him. He clinched
his hands, closed his teeth&#8212;a dangerous man, there,
under the moonlight. He cursed the gay young
lieutenant under his breath, as Adam might have
cursed the serpent who gave him, through the woman,
of that tree of knowledge that opened his eyes and
turned his paradise into a hell.

</p>


<p>
When the lights in the house were
all out, and they had all gone to
their rest or their restlessness, to
their dreams or their oblivion, the
sailor returned to his ship. Lighting
his lantern, that hung in the sheltered corner aft
where he slung his hammock, he pulled from the
breast of his shirt a little bundle of water-stained
papers. One was a long, official-looking envelope,
bearing the stamp of the Navy Department, and
evidently containing an order or an important communication.
Barry had often seen such envelopes
addressed to the admiral. The others, if he could
judge from the outside, were private letters, and the
envelopes bore, he thought, a woman's handwriting.
He arrived at this last conclusion instinctively, for
he was without familiarity with such things; he had
scarcely ever received a letter in his fifty years of
life.
</p>

<p>
He had found them that morning on the shore by
the landing, where they had fallen from the pocket of
Revere's coat the night before. Instead of handing
them to the young man, he had retained them;
moved by what idea that they might be of value to
him some day, who could say?
</p>

<p>
The envelopes had all been opened, and nothing
prevented him from examining the contents. He
was but a rude sailor; the niceties and refinements of
other ranks of life were not for him, yet he hesitated
to read the documents. Two or three times he half
drew one of the letters from its envelope only to
thrust it resolutely back. Miss Emily would not have
read them, nor the admiral either; that he knew.
Finally he gathered up the handful, put them in the
locker near where he stood, and turned the key. He
would not read them, but he would not return them,
either.
</p>

<p>
Ah, Barry, 'tis not alone hesitant woman who loses!
</p>

<p>
He had won a partial advantage, the first skirmish
in a battle which was to be renewed with increasing
force with every passing hour. He would have given
the world to have examined those documents and
papers. They would tell him something of the errand
of the man, perhaps; but he had not reached the
breaking point,&#8212;not yet, although, under the influence
of his furious jealousy and consequent animosity, he
was not far from it. Unconsciously he contrasted
Revere with himself, and suffered keenly in the ever-growing
realization of his disadvantage. Old, common,
rude, lonely, faithful, that was all,&#8212;and it was
not enough.
</p>

<p>
As for Revere, the loss of the letters, which he had
discovered when he put on his own uniform, annoyed
him somewhat, although he did not consider it
serious. That afternoon he had written to the Navy
Department detailing his accident and asking that new
orders be made out for him. He had also written to
his mother, lightly mentioning his adventure and his
lost baggage, and directing that other clothing be sent
him immediately by his man. In this letter he had enclosed
a short note for Josephine. In neither of them
did he dwell much upon Emily Sanford.
</p>

<p>
Of the trio in the house he was one to whom
oblivion did not come readily that night. He was
facing a very serious crisis in his life. He had been
betrothed to Josephine Remington, a far-off connection
of his mother, since his graduation, and the betrothal
was only the carrying out of a plan which
had long been agreed upon between the respective
families. The engagement was a matter of general
notoriety, and was an accepted fact among their many
friends. In the absence of any other affection, he had
never realized that he had not loved Josephine as he
should, and never suspected, until he had felt the
touch of genuine passion, and had become thereby an
authority upon the subject, that she did not love him
either.
</p>

<p>
But what was to be done was a grave question.
Was it right for him to make love to Emily Sanford,
which he had certainly done, by implication at least,
and which he certainly wanted to do directly and unequivocally,
under the circumstances? or, was it right
to allow Emily Sanford to fall in love with him, which,
without vanity, he felt she might do, and which he
fervently hoped with all his soul she would do, while
he was engaged to Josephine? It certainly was not
right. That was a conclusion about which there could
be no other opinion.
</p>

<p>
He finally resolved that he would treat Emily Sanford
with proper reserve, and circumspectly watch his
conduct toward her for the present. Perhaps it would
be best, after all, to try to put her out of his heart and
keep to his engagement his mind suggested faintly.
That was impossible he felt in his heart. It was Emily
or nothing. No, he could not and he would not. He
must at once secure a release from the one so that he
could have the right to woo the other honorably and
openly.
</p>

<p>
Yet, how to be free? Could he ask Josephine to
release him? What would his mother think of such
a demand, and how would his conduct in the affair be
regarded by his friends? And yet he could not carry
out his engagement. That was final. In one moment
the delusion of years which he had accepted&#8212;nay,
even encouraged&#8212;with a youth's indifference had
been swept away. Love had smitten him; his eyes,
too, had been opened. Whatever betided, there was
but one woman in the world for him. Yet he must
conceal his feeling and make no avowal until he was
free. Poor Richard! He did not realize that the man
does not live who can conceal from the woman he
loves the fact that he loves her. It is in the very air,
and nature has a thousand ways to tell the tale, with
each one of which the most untutored woman suddenly
grows familiar at the right moment.
</p>

<p>
They were puzzling and annoying questions, but,
with a conduct quite what would be expected from so
gallant a sailor, he at last made up his mind. Of one
thing he was certain,&#8212;that he loved Emily, and that
she was the only woman in the world for him. And he
would be free. So Revere, like Barry, hesitated and
was lost!
</p>

<p>
Even the situation with regard to the old ship was
a puzzling one. There would be no evading the
orders of the government. The ship must be sold to
the best advantage and broken up. Yet to destroy
the ship was to write the admiral's death-warrant. He
had to obey his orders. No sentimental considerations
would be allowed to interfere with the command
of the department. Still, how could he do it? He
did not dare tell the news to the admiral, he could not
mention it to Emily, he would not even like to declare
it to the old sailor.
</p>

<p>
The more he considered the situation the more unfortunate
the position in which he found himself. As
a lover,&#8212;of Emily, that is,&#8212;he was pledged to another
woman. As a guest of the admiral, he was
there to take away the ship. And, although he entered
little into his calculations, he might have added,
had he known it, that on both counts, ship and
maiden, he was about to break the heart of the man
who had saved his life. And all of this had been
brought about in the most innocent and unwitting
way. He felt himself, in some strange manner, the
sport of a hard and malignant fortune.
</p>

<p>
The night was still and calm to the admiral, sleeping
dreamlessly without foreboding; but to his granddaughter&#8212;ah, she was the dreamer. This young
hero, this demigod from over the sea, how he had
looked at her, how he had listened to her, how his
eyes had seemed to pierce the very depths of her
maiden soul! He had not complimented her upon
her singing; he had only asked for more and still
more. And how beautifully his voice had blended with
hers! Was he, indeed, the fairy prince come at last to
awaken the sleeping beauty of her passion,&#8212;to kiss
into life the too long dormant feeling in her heart?
</p>

<p>
There are songs without words in maidens' hearts,
and one of them rippled through the innocence of
her girlish soul in the still watches of that heavenly
night.
</p>

<p>
And they all forgot old Barry alone on the ship.

CHAPTER XI
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">Blows at the Heart</span>
</p>


<p>
Revere spent the next morning in a thorough
inspection of the ship. It was a
duty enjoined upon him in the carrying
out of his orders, and he had felt
somewhat guilty in having neglected
it the day before. His Naval Academy course had
included instruction in wooden ship-building,&#8212;iron
ships were only just beginning to be at that date,&#8212;and
he therefore viewed the <i>Susquehanna</i> with the
eyes of an expert. At his own request, he had been
attended in this survey by the sailor Barry, although
it is more than probable that, in any case, the old
man would have insisted upon accompanying him.
</p>

<p>
With what jealous pain the veteran seaman dogged
the footsteps of the young sailor and watched him
examine his beloved ship! Nothing escaped Revere's
rigid scrutiny. Barry himself, after his years of
familiarity with the old hulk, could not have made a
more exhaustive investigation. There was but one
spot which Revere did not view. That was the private
locker which the old seaman had made for himself
in the one habitable portion of the ship.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" Revere had asked, pausing before
the closed, locked door. "Your traps, eh? Well,
I guess we have no need to inspect them," he continued,
smiling, and passing on.
</p>

<p>
Yet, had he known it, behind that closed door lay
his fate, for the lost letters and papers&#8212;which Barry
had not yet read&#8212;were there.
</p>

<p>
The keen, critical examination of the old ship by
the young lieutenant enhanced the growing animosity
of the sailor. His cool comments seemed like a
profanation. Barry felt as if his enemy were appraising
the virtues of his wife; as if, examining her in
her old age, he were disappointed and surprised at
not finding in her the qualities and excellencies of
her youth. Every prying finger touch, crumbling the
rotting wood, was a desecration. Every blow struck
upon the timbers to test their soundness was an
added insult.
</p>

<p>
Had the young man been less intent upon that
task he would have seen in the clouded brow, the
closed lips, the stern expression upon his companion's
face something of the older man's exacerbated feelings;
but, engrossed by his inspection, he noticed
nothing. Indeed, like many very young naval officers
of the time, he thought but little of the sailor at
best. He was a part&#8212;and a very essential part&#8212;of
the vast naval machine, of course, but otherwise
nothing. When Revere grew older he would learn
to estimate the value of the man upon the yard-arm,
the man behind the gun, and to rate him more highly;
but at present his attitude was more or less one of
indifference.
</p>

<p>
It was true that Barry, equally with Emily, had
saved his life; but by a perfectly natural trick of the
mind&#8212;or heart, rather&#8212;all the heroism of that
splendid achievement had focussed itself about the
woman, and to Revere the man became an incident
rather than a cause,&#8212;merely a detail. Just as the
captain who leads the forlorn hope gets the mention
in the despatches and enrolls his name upon the
pages of history, to the exclusion of those other men,
perhaps no less brave than he, who followed him, so
Emily stood to the fore, and Barry's part was already
half forgotten. This carelessly oblivious attitude of
mind, which he divined even in the absence of any
very specific outward evidence of it, added to the exasperation
of the sailor, and he fairly hated the officer.
</p>

<p>
"There are certain categories of the mind which
must be true, else would reason reel and totter on its
throne." As an illustration, we cannot think of love
without thinking of hate, and perhaps the capacity
for one may be measured by the ability for the other.
The man who loves high things, burns with corresponding
hatred for the base,&#8212;or else something is
lacking in his love; and, as is the case with all other
antitheses of sentiment, both feelings find lodgment
in the normal mind.
</p>

<p>
Barry had loved through years. He had loved the
admiral, he had loved the ship, and, above all, he had
loved the girl. The peaceful, quiet, even tenor of
his life had offered no lodgment for antagonisms. To
love, to serve,&#8212;that had been his happy existence.
Living alone on Ship House Point, attending to his
simple duties, wrapped up in his devotion, he had
found neither cause nor reason for hatred, and when
that awful passion found a lodgment in his bosom, it
came so suddenly, so violently, that it destroyed the
mental and spiritual balance of the man. The faculty
of hating had years of disuse to make up for, and
the feeling swept over him like a tidal wave, uncontrollable,
appalling. The swiftness with which it developed
had but added to his confusion. There is
love at first sight, but there is antipathy as well. He
was a living illustration of the latter fact.
</p>

<p>
So perverted had become the sailor's mind, under
the influence of this rising feeling, that in his bewilderment
he sometimes fancied that his antipathy was
universal,&#8212;that he hated the admiral, the ship, Emily,
himself! Yet this could not be; and in calmer moments,
although without the power of analysis, he
realized dumbly that these griping emotions were
but the concomitants of his obsession.
</p>

<p>
Of all this the lieutenant was yet blithely unconscious.
It is said that but a single object can engross
the mind at one time, and that concepts of
other objects, even if simultaneous therewith, are
merely auxiliary thereto. Emily filled Revere's mental
horizon to the exclusion of everything else. It
was with difficulty he kept his mind away from her
when, in pursuance of his duty, he inspected the
ship. To Barry he paid but little attention, noticing
him, if at all, in the most perfunctory way. Disassociated
from Emily, the sailor counted for nothing.
</p>

<p>
To his relief and Barry's, presently the long task
was over. The duty discharged, the two men scrambled
down the battens which Barry had nailed to the
side of the hulk to enable him to pass to and from
the deck, and stood on the grass in the shadow of
the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Revere, "she has been a fine ship in
her day, Barry."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir; none better."
</p>

<p>
"See how sharp she is in the lines of her bow;
look at the graceful swell forward. See how she fines
down in her run aft, yonder. She should have been
a good goer. The ship was built for speed as well
as strength; and probably she was laid out by the
rule-of-thumb, too," he continued, reflectively. "We
don't build better to-day, with all our boasted science.
Yes, she was a fine ship. I should like to have commanded
her; but she is worthless now."
</p>

<p>
"Worthless!" exploded the old sailor, darkly;
"worthless!"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely. There is hardly a sound plank in
her. The iron bolts, even, are rusted. I wonder
how she holds together. The habit of years, perhaps;
nothing else, surely. She's a positive danger.
Some day she'll fall to pieces, and, if I were you, I'd
sleep elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
"My God, sir!" exclaimed the old man, wrathfully,
his face changing; "you don't know what you're
sayin'! You can't mean it! Me leave the ship!
I've slept on her for twenty-five years. You're
wrong, sir! She's good for many a year yet. Some
of the planks is rottin', I grant you, but most of the
frames is good yet, an' she's sound at the heart.
She'll weather many a storm, you'll see. Sound at
the heart! Leave her! I'll leave her when she
falls, and the admiral, too. He's an old man. My
father sailed with him; he was a man when I was a
boy; yet he's alive still, an' he'll live as long as she
does, too."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, man!" said Revere; "you are dreaming!
The ship ought to be broken up. She might be
worth something as stove-wood of inferior quality,"
he continued, carelessly, and ruthlessly, too; "but I
tell you she's a menace to every one who comes here."
</p>

<p>
"Broken up, sir!" gasped the man, forgetting duty,
courtesy, everything, in his anger; "by heaven, I'd
rather set fire to her with my own hands an' burn
her down! Burn the life out of the admiral, an' out
of me, too, than a timber on her should be touched!
I tell you, I've lived on her. I know her. I love her!
Don't dare to&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Barry," said the young man, quickly,
but with great firmness, "you are rated a boatswain's
mate in the United States navy, I believe, and as
such I will have to caution you not to address me in
this imperious way. There, man, hang it all, I
oughtn't to have said that, perhaps," he continued,
as he saw the man's face working with grief and rage.
"You saved my life, you know, and the ship, I suppose,
is dear to you, and I can well understand it.
We'll say no more about it."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to God I hadn't," muttered the sailor, entirely
unmollified.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, that's rather ungracious of you; but,
never mind, you did, and I can forgive an old salt a
good deal; only there is one thing I must say: Miss
Emily must not go aboard the ship any more. You
can risk your life if you want to, but I won't have
her risk hers; it's dangerous."
</p>

<p>
The old man noted the cool, proprietary note in the
voice, and broke into fury; difference of rank and
station quite obliterated from his perturbed mind.
</p>

<p>
"Mustn't, sir! Mustn't! I may be a bo's'n's
mate, sir, an' you can command me, but you've got
no call to say 'mustn't' to Miss Emily."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not; but I shall speak to the admiral.
There, now, that will do. Keep cool. No harm's
done. I have inspected the ship and shall report on
her."
</p>

<p>
"What are you goin' to report, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, by George! If you are not the most extraordinary
blue-jacket I ever saw! What I report
will be sent to the Secretary of the Navy. I do not
publish it to the ship's crew. What's the matter with
you, man? Pull yourself together. You seem to be
in a dreadful state."
</p>

<p>
"What are you goin' to do with the ship?" insisted
Barry, savagely.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to do anything with her. I have
been sent here to report on her, and I shall report."
</p>

<p>
The situation had become tense. The young officer
felt that he had humored the sailor long enough; indeed,
that he had allowed him far more freedom in his
address than he would had given any one else. Ignorant
of the mainspring of the man's apparent antipathy to
him, possessing no clew to the cause of it, unable to
divine Barry's mental condition, he had been greatly
surprised by his insolent and insulting conduct. It
seemed to the lieutenant that his forbearance had
reached its limit, and that something would have to
give way. In another second there would have been
trouble.
</p>

<p>
The state of affairs was relieved by the cause of it,
for Emily appeared on the brow of the hill at that
moment and called to the sailor. The old man instantly
turned on his heel and, without deigning to
notice the young man, walked toward her. Revere
followed him promptly, and both men arrived at the
top of the hill before her at the same moment.
</p>

<p>
By a violent effort the sailor had smoothed some of
the passion out of his face, though he still looked
white and angry.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Captain Barry?" she asked,
noticing his altered visage.
</p>

<p>
The man stood silent before her, not trusting himself
to speak, especially as it would have been difficult
to assign a tangible cause for his feelings, real though
they were.
</p>

<p>
"I think I can tell you, Miss Emily," said Revere,
pleasantly. "I have been inspecting the ship, and the
man has not liked my opinion of her, I fancy."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Barry is very fond of the old ship, Mr.
Revere," said Emily, quietly, "and I doubt not that
any inspection of her hurts him."
</p>

<p>
The sailor looked at the girl gratefully, as a dog
might have done. The young man's heart went out
to her, too, for her kindly championship of the older
man. He was glad, indeed, that she had found a
way to dispel his anger, for the lieutenant was a kind-hearted
young fellow, and would have all others
about him happy, especially in this beginning of his
romance.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, generously, "perhaps I did speak
rather harshly of the ship. You see I hardly realized
how you all love the old thing, and indeed 'tis a fine,
melancholy old picture."
</p>

<p>
"It always reminds me of grandfather and Captain
Barry&#8212;old on the one hand, strong on the other,"
responded Emily, divining the instinct of consideration
in his heart that had prompted Revere's words,
and smiling graciously at him.
</p>

<p>
It was reward enough for him, he thought, as he returned
her approving glance with interest.
</p>

<p>
"You called me, Miss Emily," said the uncompromising
Barry, speaking at last. "Do you want
me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I am going over to the village, and I wish you
to row me across the harbor."
</p>

<p>
"By no means, Miss Emily," broke in Revere,
promptly. "I claim that honor for myself."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you are quite strong enough to
do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Strong enough!" he exclaimed. "Certainly I
am! I should like nothing better. Besides, I have
business in the town myself: I expect answers to
some letters and my man with a portmanteau and
some other clothes. I should be delighted to row
you to the village or anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Emily, hesitating, "Captain Barry always
rows me and&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"All the more reason for giving him a rest; he is
old and will be glad of this relief. Let the duty be
performed by younger hands. Come, then, if you
will allow me."
</p>

<p>
Barry stood silent during this little colloquy. His
face, when Emily glanced at it, was as impassive as if
he had been a stone image. He was putting great
constraint upon himself, determined not to betray his
feeling. If she could choose Revere, the acquaintance
of a moment, and disregard him, the servant of
years, let her do so. He would see. Not by word
or look would he try to influence her. If he had
ever heard of the Spartan with the wolf at his vitals,
he would have realized what the story meant then.
</p>

<p>
Now, Emily much preferred to have Revere row
her; he was a much more congenial companion than
the grim, silent sailor. There was a sympathy, already
an affection, developing between them which made
her greatly enjoy his society. She would not have
hesitated a moment, therefore, but for a certain
understanding of the feeling entertained for her by
the sailor. Not a sufficient comprehension, however,
to amount to an assurance, but a deep enough
realization to give her pause. What woman is there
without that much comprehension? But when she
saw Barry standing before her, impassive, stern,
apparently indifferent, her hesitation left her for the
moment, and, bidding the sailor inform her grandfather
of her departure, she turned and descended the
hill, followed by the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
As the two walked away the tension on the man
was released or broken. He stood trembling, looking
after them. A flower which Emily had been
wearing had fallen upon the walk. In other days he
would have picked it up and carried it carefully to
the ship as a priceless treasure. Now he ground it
brutally under his heavy heel and stared at them, almost
unconscious of his action, quivering with voiceless
rage. Presently he went up to the old admiral,
sitting dreaming on the porch, and, having mastered
himself somewhat again, delivered his message.
</p>

<p>
Out in the harbor the little skiff, the same by means
of which Revere's life had been saved, danced merrily
along.
</p>

<p>
"I like to see the young people together, Barry,"
said the old man, gazing after them. "'Twas a fortunate
gale that wrecked him at our door. We shall be
going soon, you and I and the ship, and who will take
care of Emily then? Perhaps&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
He spoke slowly and he did not finish the sentence,
yet the concluding thought was perfectly plain to the
sailor.
</p>

<p>
He raged over it as he returned to the ship.

For the preliminary stages in the making

<p class="caption">For the preliminary stages in the making of love there is scarcely anything that is so delightful &#8230; as

</p>

<p>
Emily sat aft in the seat of honor, holding
the yoke-lines and steering the skiff. In front of, and
facing, her was Revere, with the oars, which, impelled
by his powerful arms, afforded the motive power that
speeded the boat on her way. He had been well
trained, of course, and he rowed with the skill of a practised
oarsman, a long, steady man-o'-war stroke, quick
on the recover, delicate in the feather, deep and strong
in the pull, which sent the boat flying over the water.
</p>

<p>
It was a sunny, delightful morning. The breeze
blew soft over the harbor, and the water, rippling,
bubbling, and lipping around the prow, made music
suited indeed to words of love and beating hearts.
Yet what they said was commonplace enough, after
all. They did not say anything, in fact, for a few
moments after they had pushed off from the little
wharf. Revere was quite content to drink in the
exquisite beauty of the young girl reclining in the
stern-sheets before him.
</p>

<p>
He marked the freshness and sweetness of her face,
the graceful curves of her vigorous, yet lissome, young
body, and her dainty feet&#8212;the admiral was too
thorough an aristocrat not to see his granddaughter
well booted&#8212;peeping out from beneath the hem of
her cool, flowing muslin skirt before him. From
under her quaint, old-fashioned bonnet&#8212;a species of
poke in vogue a year or two before&#8212;her blue eyes
fearlessly and happily returned the ardent and admiring
glances of his own. Lest the silence should
prove embarrassing to her, however, and noticing, at
last, that she dropped her eyes before him, he said,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"I'd give a penny for your thoughts, Miss Emily,
if I thought the coin would prove the open sesame
to your mind."
</p>

<p>
"I was only thinking how beautifully you row, and
wondering&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, wondering?"
</p>

<p>
"How soon you had recovered from your accident,
and how much better and stronger you seem than
when I had to help you up the hill yesterday morning."
</p>

<p>
He laughed at this clever thrust, rather shamefacedly,
it must be admitted, and flushed at the same
time, while he answered her.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you will think me a great hypocrite,"
he admitted, contritely, realizing that he could lose
nothing by frankness; "certainly, I am feeling very
delightful&#8212;I mean, well and comfortable, now."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you are rowing in the hot sun! Now, I do
not see how you can be comfortable at all, and I do
not believe, since you feel so well now, that you
needed any assistance whatever in getting up the hill.
You deceived me. Neither my grandfather nor Captain
Barry ever do that," she continued, gravely, at
the same time looking reprovingly at him. She
leaned back in the boat, as if the matter was decided.
"I wanted to speak to you about it before,
but there was always some one around."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Emily, let me explain," he exclaimed, filled
with shame, surprised, yet pleased, to think she should
take so trifling a matter so seriously. "You see," he
added, half in jest and half in earnest, "after saving
my life so gallantly the other night, I had rather a
feeling of&#8212;er&#8212;dependence upon you, you know, the
next morning, and it seemed natural and appropriate
to ask you to help me up the hill. I could have gone
up myself I&#8212;I suppose&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you are honest now, at any rate. I
must say you seemed to acquire the feeling very
lightly."
</p>

<p>
"Of honesty? Thank you!"
</p>

<p>
"I mean of dependence."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't. I never had it before. You see, it's
dangerous to save a life. The one who is saved
always feels that he belongs to the one who saves.
Now, I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"How do you know so much about it?" she broke
in, with instinctive promptness. She would like to
have him complete his sentence, and yet, like all
women, she tried to put it off; hence her interruption.
"Did you ever save any one's life?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, once," he replied, rather reluctantly, inwardly
perturbed at the turn the conversation was taking.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how was it?" she questioned, interestedly,
dropping her tone of banter instantly. "Was it a
fellow-officer?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"A sailor, then?" anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No; a young lady," desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a young lady!" she exclaimed in dismay,
with a note of disappointment in her voice that she
endeavored in vain to suppress, and which he was
very glad indeed to recognize.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; one summer at Cape May. She got beyond
her depth in the surf, and I swam out and brought
her ashore without any great difficulty. Not a very
romantic story, is it? Not half as much as&#8212;I
mean, not at all&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I think it very romantic indeed," answered
this child of nature, whose notions of romance and
love and other things were drawn from the antique
novels of her grandfather's library; "if I had saved
any one's life I should&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
She stopped and blushed furiously as the natural
answer to her impetuous remark sprang into her mind.
</p>

<p>
"I will finish for you," interrupted Revere, eagerly,
his resolution of reticence recorded in his determination
of the previous night growing decidedly faint in
the face of the fascination she exercised over him.
"I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
He would have gone on, but something in her
glance stopped him. With the quickness of love and
intense sympathy he divined that the hour was not
yet. There was an unspoken appeal in her eyes, in
her burning cheek, her trembling hand, her heaving
breast, which he could not disregard. He had been
on the brink of an avowal. Thank heaven, he had
stopped in time! For her sake and for his own he
would be on his guard. He would not transgress
again. He vowed it in his soul.
</p>

<p>
"I am deeply grateful," he went on, after a pause
which somehow, in spite of him, expressed all he
wished her to understand, "both to you and the
sailor, and I hope to evidence my devotion and gratitude
in some tangible way. By the way, what a
strange character he seems! He appears to have
taken a dislike to me. He said this morning he
wished he had not saved me."
</p>

<p>
"How dared he speak so?" cried the girl, sitting
up in the boat, her face flushed this time with indignation.
"Not save your life? Why&#8212;but there,"
she went on, swiftly recovering herself, "he is a
strange creature, as you say, and moody at times.
He lives alone on the ship, and sees no one but
grandfather and me. He is devoted to me. He would
do anything for me."
</p>

<p>
"Those queer things in your room,&#8212;the harpoon,
the shark's tooth, the model of the ship?"
</p>

<p>
"He put them there. They are odd things for a
girl's room, are they not? but when you realize that
they express the affection of an honest, faithful heart,
they become quite fitting for any woman. Yes, I
am fond of him, and I love those things for his
sake. He is devoted to the admiral and to the ship,
too."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Richard Revere was too profoundly conscious
of the vast difference between Emily Sanford and
any common sailor to feel the slightest jealousy at
her ungrudging praise; indeed, he liked it.
</p>

<p>
"So I discovered," he assented, appreciatively.
"Miss Emily, you go down to that ship sometimes;
often, I suppose. Please do not go any more."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" curiously.
</p>

<p>
"It is very insecure. I do not see how it can last
much longer. Some day it will collapse into shapeless
ruin; soon, I think. And if you were there&#8212;&#8212;"
He hesitated and looked at her. "Please do not
go," he continued.
</p>

<p>
"But it will break Captain Barry's heart to have
me refuse. I've always gone."
</p>

<p>
She spoke doubtfully, as if seeking a further reason.
</p>

<p>
"Better break his heart than throw away your
life. Believe me, I have made a thorough inspection
of the ship. It's unsafe. It's almost gone. I
marvel that it stands now."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old ship!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, 'tis sad indeed. But you won't go, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not&#8212;not&#8212;if you do not wish me,&#8212;I mean, not
if it is unsafe," she answered, softly, looking down.
</p>

<p>
He had shot the boat in toward the shore of a little
island in the harbor, and there, under the deep shadow
of some overhanging trees, he stopped rowing, as he
said, to rest a moment, just keeping the boat under
control with the oars.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old ship!" continued the girl, mournfully,
as she dabbled her sunburnt but shapely hand in the
water; "when it goes, grandfather will go, Captain
Barry will go, and I will be left&#8212;alone."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" he exclaimed, softly, all his resolution
gone in the face of the powerful yet innocent appeal.
"Not alone, for I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"That girl?" she interrupted, meaningly.
</p>

<p>
"What girl?" impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"The one you saved. Is she beautiful?"
</p>

<p>
"Some people consider her so, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"What is she like?" breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"She is tall and rather large. She has brown hair
and brown eyes. She has been beautifully educated,
and she is exquisitely bred."
</p>

<p>
"She sings, too, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; her voice has been very highly cultivated."
</p>

<p>
"And you have sung to her, with her?" sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"That song we sang together last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; she only sings classical music. I think
she would disdain a simple ballad."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said the girl, with much disappointment,
and humiliation as well; "I suppose they are simple,
after all."
</p>

<p>
"I prefer them myself," answered Revere, tenderly.
</p>

<p>
The conversation was getting dangerous. She
changed the subject at once.
</p>

<p>
"Have you made many cruises?"
</p>

<p>
"Only one. As soon as I was graduated I was
ordered to the <i>Hartford</i>; but I was abroad when a
lad, before I entered the Naval Academy."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you have seen a great many beautiful
and high-bred ladies in Boston and elsewhere?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a great many, indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Are they all very beautiful and charming?"
</p>

<p>
"Some of them are," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," she said at last, desperately, "there
are none of them like me?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" he replied, decisively.
</p>

<p>
"Is it so?" sadly. "Am I so different?"
</p>

<p>
"As different as day from night," joyously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," softly, and with deep disappointment; "I
have never been anywhere but just here. I have
never seen any great ladies at all. I have never met
any gentlemen except grandfather and&#8212;you. I do
not know anything about the world beyond the horizon;
but I have tried to read and learn, and I have
dreamed about it, too. But I suppose one has to go
and see before one can know of the people you speak
of. You must think me so&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Emily," he said, his voice quivering with his feelings,
"I have known you but two days, but I think
you are the loveliest, the sweetest&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
She waved her hand in deprecation; but he would
not be stopped this time. Truly he had forgotten all
but his love for her.
</p>

<p>
"You do not know what the others know; I love
you for that," he went on, impetuously. "You do not
do what others do; I love you for that. You are not
what the others are; I love you for that. There, it is
out now. I did not mean to tell you just yet. I do
not suppose that you can love me; at least, not yet.
There is nothing in me that would win a woman's
heart in two days, I know. But there is everything
in you to win a man's heart in one glance; and I swear
mine went out to you when I saw you holding the
boat on the edge of the whirlpool, with your golden
hair blown back in the wind and your blue eyes
shining with encouragement and invitation."
</p>

<p>
It was heavenly to hear him, she thought. This
was better than her dreams. She sat silent and still,
her eyes persistently averted, quaffing deep draughts
from a cup eternal, besides which even the nepenthe
of the gods is evanescent.
</p>

<p>
"I won't ask you to answer me now; but will
you not give me a trial?" he continued, hurriedly,
fearing lest her silence might presage a refusal. "Let
me have a chance to win your love, if I can. Let
me see if I cannot make you love me. Won't you
let me try? Emily, you are not even looking at
me."
</p>

<p>
He was quite beside himself with anxiety now.
She had been still so long. What could he do or
say further? A small boat has its disadvantages for
the ending of a love affair. In all his impatience he
had to sit just where he was. He could come no
nearer to her.
</p>

<p>
"If I could, Emily dear," he said, humbly beseeching
her, "I would get down on my knees before you;
but I can't in this little boat. Won't you please look
at me? But perhaps you can more easily give me
some hope if you don't look at me. Don't look.
I'm not a very attractive fellow, I know."
</p>

<p>
This was an adroit move on his part, and his self-depreciation
won a reply instantly.
</p>

<p>
"I&#8212;I like you very much," she said at last and
very frankly. "I think I liked you when Captain
Barry carried you up the hill,&#8212;even before, when you
stood on the wreck. I wanted to help him. I don't
know whether I&#8212;love you, but&#8212;what you have said
has not been displeasing to me&#8212;on the contrary&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"And you will try, you will wait? May I&#8212;&#8212;?"
</p>

<p>
He waited breathless for her answer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said at last, "you may."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Emily!" he cried; "you have made me the
happiest fellow on earth; and if I succeed in winning
your love&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not despair," she whispered, softly, flashing a
glance at him, her lips smiling, her eyes ashine with
tears. "I think it has come," laying her hand on her
heart with a sweet, unconscious movement. "I have
dreamed ever since I was a woman that the prince
would come some day from over the sea."
</p>

<p>
She stopped again. He stared at her in adoring
silence. Her lips trembled, while her heart almost
ceased to beat with the joy of it all. And her eyes
were looking far away&#8212;over the sea, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
"We must not stay here longer," she said at last;
"they will wonder what has become of us."
</p>

<p>
"You are the captain," he answered, laughing
buoyantly in his happiness; "give your crew the
order."
</p>

<p>
"Get under way, then," she replied, meeting his
mood.
</p>

<p>
The little love scene had put strength into his arms.
It seemed as if the power of his passion, failing
other vent, had worked itself into the oar-blades,
for the boat skimmed over the water like a bird, and in
a few moments he unshipped his oars at the boat-landing.
Swinging the skiff about so that the stern
would be nearest the landing-place for her convenience,
he stepped ashore, fastened the painter, and
gave her his hand. Her own small palm met his
great one frankly, and the two hands clung together
in a clasp,&#8212;on his part of joy unspeakable, on hers
of happy foreshadowings of the future.
</p>

<p>
Neither said anything as he helped her gravely up
the steps. To kiss her then, even had they been
alone, would have seemed to him sacrilege; there
was something so holy, so innocent, so pure about the
young girl, he thought, that he would like to throw
himself upon his knees before her and kiss the steps
her feet had trodden, so rapturous was his mood. Yet
again, when he broke the silence, his words were
commonplace. The noblest word would be ordinary
when matched against his feelings then!
</p>

<p>
"What a sleepy, dull, dead little town this seems!"
he remarked, looking curiously about him; "if it
were a little handsomer, and overgrown with flowers
and vines, it might be the town of the Sleeping Beauty;
but the Beauty&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Is wide awake," she interrupted, a charming color
irradiating her cheek, which made him sorry he had
been so timid. "And awake without the prince's
kiss, too!" she added, smiling archly, in that she was
a very woman.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, he thought, ruefully, she might not have
resented that kiss, after all.
</p>

<p>
Well, the next time would see!

CHAPTER XIII
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">Love Holds the Yoke-Lines</span>
</p>


<p>
As he anticipated, Revere found his man
with a well-filled portmanteau and
several letters awaiting him at the
little old-fashioned country inn of the
village. The morning was far spent
when Emily finished her simple purchases, and the
two lovers lunched together in the quaint old parlor
of the inn. The girl, in her innocence of the customs
of the world, was quite oblivious to the conventional
necessity for a chaperon; so, without the embarrassment
of a third party, they greatly enjoyed the
wholesome and substantial meal provided for them
by the skilful hands of the innkeeper's wife with
whom Emily was a great favorite. They lingered a
long time at the table in the cool old-fashioned room,
and it was somewhat late in the afternoon when they
started back to the Point, to which Revere had previously
directed his man to repair with his baggage,
by the land road.
</p>

<p>
The constraint which had been put upon both of
them by the necessities of the business which had
called them to the village, and the presence of other
people wherever they went, for the officious but well-meaning landlady had frequently interrupted the
privacy of the parlor even, had been the strongest
force in developing the growing passions in their
hearts.
</p>

<p>
Emily was a simple-minded maiden, with all the
attributes of a very old-fashioned age. She had no
mission to reform this world, which indeed she had
found most sweet and fair, and sweeter and fairer
that day than ever before; she stood for no so-called
modern idea; she had no deep plan or mighty purpose
for the amelioration of mankind,&#8212;or womankind
either; she did not aim at the achievement of
great results, the doing of mighty deeds. The complexities
of her character did not manifest themselves
in these ways.
</p>

<p>
Woman's sphere for her, if she thought of it specifically
at all, was a very simple and a very old thing.
To love and to be loved, to be first a faithful, happy
wife, and second, please God, a wise, devoted mother,
was the sum of her ambition.
</p>

<p>
There were no young men with whom she came in
contact who could measure up to the standard of her
social and intellectual requirements, and the chances
that any would present themselves had been exceedingly
small. So she had represented in her life a hope
deferred, but without being heart-sick with the delay;
she was of so sane, so healthy, and so happy a
disposition that she had been saved all that. With the
optimism of youth she had confidently expected that
some day the prince would arrive, and when he came,
together hand in hand they would go "over the hills
and far away, to that new land which is the old."
And the portals of that undiscovered country were
now opening before her delighted vision.
</p>

<p>
Barely out of her teens, she had not grown impatient
in her dreaming,&#8212;life had been too sweet
and pleasant for that,&#8212;but the thoughtful and somewhat
lonely years had made her ready, and it was
no wonder that at the touch she yielded. When
Revere came to her out of the deep, cast up at her
feet by the waves of the sea, as it were, he fitted into
anticipation already old. He represented the realization
of her maidenly desires and her womanly
hopes. That she should fall in love with him was
entirely natural and quite to be expected, especially
since he was blessed with a personality at once
strong, lovable, and charming.
</p>

<p>
The reserve and the calmness of Revere's long
line of Boston ancestry had been tempered, modified,
brightened, by his sailor life and by his intimate contact
with great and heroic men in the war which was
just over. Frank, genial, generous, and not without
a certain high-bred distinction in his manner, and
blessed with a sufficiency of manly good looks, he
might well have hoped to win any woman's heart.
</p>

<p>
The day had been a happy one to Emily, then; happier
for her than for Revere, in fact, for that young
man's conscience troubled him deeply, while there was
no cloud on her sweet pleasure. If he had not been
engaged to Josephine he would have revelled in his
love for Emily; but he was not free. He was now
bound to two women at the same time, and not in
strictly honorable relationship to either. The false
position was almost unbearable to a man of his fine
sensitiveness, and that he had made it himself did
not make it less easy to endure. He firmly resolved
to extricate himself from his dilemma by informing
Josephine at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
No other course was left to him. Since he had seen
and known Emily he felt that it would be impossible
for him to keep his previous engagement, and yet he
realized that it would have been more honorable for
him to have controlled himself as he had determined,
better to have been less precipitate and to have waited
until he had gained his release before he offered himself
to Emily.
</p>

<p>
Carried away by his feelings, he had proposed to
her in the boat, and he regretted, not the fact,&#8212;never
that,&#8212;but that he had been so little master of
himself, that he could not have delayed his wooing
for a few days, until, being made free, he could definitely
and properly and honorably ask her for her
hand. He felt, for instance, that he could not speak to
the old admiral upon the subject until he had secured
his release. It would be impossible for him to approach
that soul of ancient honor other than free.
</p>

<p>
Yet when he looked at the girl; when the clear,
sweet notes of her fresh young voice thrilled in his
ear; when walking by her side her dress brushed
against him; when by chance or design he touched
her, or her hand met his; when she looked at him
out of those frank, honest blue eyes; when he saw
the color come and go in her cheek, marked the
beating of her heart, caught the unconscious affection
with which her eye dwelt upon him at times,
when she thought herself unobserved, he vowed that
he stood excused in his own heart for his precipitancy.
</p>

<p>
Every moment when she did not feel and know
that he loved her he, in his turn, counted a moment
lost. He could hardly wait to get back to the house,
where he determined to write to Josephine instantly
and apprise her of the situation. He felt, as a matter
of course, that she was too proud a woman to
hold him to an unwilling engagement for a single
moment. Whether she loved him or not he could
not say. He thought not, he hoped not. Their engagement
had been a matter-of-fact affair, and the
courtship had been rather a cool one. He was perfectly
certain that she liked him, but that was very
different. He had never once seen her breath come
quicker when he approached her, the color flush or
fade in her cheek as he spoke to her. But he could
not be sure. The veneer of birth, custom, and environment
had not been worn off of her as it had been
stripped from him, and her outward action beneath
all this coolness afforded no infallible guide to her
feelings.
</p>

<p>
If she loved him, that would indeed complicate the
matter, but there could be&#8212;there must be&#8212;no other
issue than that the engagement should be broken. He
would be very sorry for her in that case, but there
would be nothing else to be done. He could not help
it that he had fallen in love with some one else, and the
only honorable thing to do now was to tell the
truth at once and break away. A man's reasoning,
certainly!
</p>

<p>
As they approached the wharf where the boat was
tied Emily noticed that Revere looked pale and tired.
The violent current of his thoughts, the acuteness of
the mental struggle in which he found himself involved,
together with his low physical condition, had
worn him out. Therefore the girl insisted upon rowing
back herself.
</p>

<p>
Even in the dependence of the first love of a young
maiden there is a feeling of protection, a foreshadowing
of the instinct maternal, which is the foundation
of most of the good things in this life, even of
the habit and practice of religion. Emily, while she
gloried in his virile manhood and dwelt happily upon
his strength and vigor, already watched over Revere
as she might have looked after a child. And she
delighted in the opportunity of doing her lover further
service. So Omphale might have considered
Hercules.
</p>

<p>
"I want to show you how beautifully I can pull
an oar," she artfully said, in answer to his expostulation,
herself only half comprehending the deep springs
of action that lay in her being; "and you look so
tired. You know you are not yet strong. I ought
not to have allowed you to come."
</p>

<p>
The sense of ownership implied in her last words
was delightful to both of them.
</p>

<p>
"I am tired," he said, honestly, "but not too tired
to row you back; and I wouldn't have missed this
little voyage for all the cruises of a lifetime. Please
get into the boat and take the yoke-lines."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Emily; "you said I was captain, and I
mean to exercise the privileges of my position. Take
the yoke-lines yourself. I insist upon it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well," assented the young sailor, smiling
at her; "I have been under orders, it seems to me,
ever since I was born. First mother, then Josephine,
and now you."
</p>

<p>
He sat down in the stern-sheets with affected resignation
and gathered up the yoke-lines.
</p>

<p>
Emily's face had changed somewhat at this last remark,
but she said nothing as she cast off the painter,
stepped to the thwart, shoved off the boat, broke out
the oars, and pulled away. She rowed a pretty stroke,
quite as deft as Revere's had been, though lacking
somewhat in power. As they cleared the wharf and
headed out into the bay toward the Point she looked
up at him.
</p>

<p>
"You have always been under orders, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"First your mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And then,&#8212;who did you say?" with poorly simulated
indifference.
</p>

<p>
"Josephine,&#8212;Miss Josephine Remington," carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"And who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's an old friend of the family, a connection
in a far-off way. She has lived with us pretty much
since she was a child."
</p>

<p>
"Are you fond of her?" coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," with mischievous promptness.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so," looking away.
</p>

<p>
"But not so fond of her as I am of you, Emily,"
tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Is that really true?" eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Upon my word and honor," with convincing
assurance.
</p>

<p>
"And you don't love her?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit. I love only one person in the world,
and that is you," passionately.
</p>

<p>
"Was she the girl you saved?" relieved, but still
somewhat anxious.
</p>

<p>
"She was."
</p>

<p>
"Does she love you, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not. She never gave me half as much
evidence of caring for me as&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"As what?" she asked in swift alarm.
</p>

<p>
"As&#8212;forgive me, Emily&#8212;as you have this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
She stopped pulling instantly, her oar-blades lifted
from the water in mid-stroke, drops trickling from
them.
</p>

<p>
"Have I been bold and forward?" she cried in dismay.
"Oh, what must you think of me?"
</p>

<p>
"You have been perfect," he answered, fervently;
"simply perfect. I wouldn't have you changed an
iota in any way. Don't let's talk about other people
now. I'd rather talk about you. Tell me something
about yourself, about the life you have lived, what you
have done, what you have thought, what you have
dreamed; tell me everything. I want to know it all."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but are you sure you do not love her?"
</p>

<p>
"I never was so certain of anything in my life,
except it be that I love you."
</p>

<p>
There was conviction in his voice which comforted
her soul. Still, she sought enlightenment upon another
point.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure she doesn't love you?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it is very improbable."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't, then!" she exclaimed, vigorously
resuming her stroke. "You saved her life, and I
don't see how she could help it," she continued.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't save your life, though, Emily."
</p>

<p>
The boat was in the shadow of the island trees,
where it had been when he had first spoken of love
to her that morning. She let it drift; again the
water made sweet music lipping along the side; they
would associate it forever with these ineffable moments.
</p>

<p>
"No," she murmured, her honesty and innocence
giving her courage to say that which another might
have sought to conceal, "you didn't, but&#8212;I don't
believe&#8212;I can&#8212;help it, either."
</p>

<p>
It was out now. His love had shown her her own.
She was another woman; never again would she look
at life with the eyes of the girl of yesterday. Ferdinand
had come to Miranda; and Ariel had opened
the eyes of the maiden to new things on the old
island more wonderful than those revealed by Prospero's
magic wand. And to Revere, too, the complexion
of the world suddenly and swiftly altered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Emily, you don't mean it!" he cried in exultant
surprise. He had not hoped so soon for this
revelation of the woman's heart.
</p>

<p>
Her face was averted now, but she spoke distinctly
enough for him to hear every whispered word.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think&#8212;I believe&#8212;I do. I have thought
about it a great deal since you spoke."&#8212;Three
hours ago! "And I believe I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
She could not quite say it&#8212;yet.
</p>

<p>
"Emily, dearest, I am so happy it seems to me I
can hardly breathe. I do not dare to look at you.
I love you so! Come, let us hurry back to the
shore."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Revere&#8212;&#8212;" she began, starting the boat
again.
</p>

<p>
"That will not do at all," he interrupted, promptly
and decisively; "you must call me something else&#8212;now
that you&#8212;oh, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Richard," she said, bravely.
</p>

<p>
"Those who love me call me 'Dick,'" pleadingly.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't say that&#8212;not just yet&#8212;Dick!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed in sheer pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"I never knew what a pretty name I had before,
Emily."
</p>

<p>
"I think it is lovely," she said, na&#239;vely.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you. Do you like my other name, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ever so much."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad, because it will be yours. Mrs.
Richard Revere."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, how can you!" she cried, blushing furiously.
"I want to ask one thing of you. Do not say
anything about&#8212;to-day. That is, to grandfather or
Captain Barry,&#8212;not just yet."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not likely to say anything about it to Captain
Barry now or at any other time," he laughed; "and
as for the admiral, it will do no harm for us to wait a
day or two, I fancy,&#8212;that is, if you wish it, princess."
</p>

<p>
Her desire suited his plans admirably, for the delay
would give him time to write and get his freedom.
</p>

<p>
"I want to enjoy it first alone," she went on,
dreamily. "I want to have the knowledge that you
love me all to myself, just for a day. It's so sacred,
and so solemn a thing to me, Richard; so beautiful,
that I want to keep it just here in my heart alone, for
a little while."
</p>

<p>
She laid her hand upon her heart with the sweetest
gesture as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"It shall be so," he answered, frankly, adoring her.
"Whatever you wish shall always be, if I can bring
it about."
</p>

<p>
Oh, the rash promises of lovers!
</p>

<p>
"And you will let me have my happiness to myself,
then? You will not think me foolish?"
</p>

<p>
"Not all to yourself, for, though I do not speak, I
must still share it, and I think you are perfect in everything."
</p>

<p>
"We are at the wharf," she murmured. "I must
go up to the house alone. Do not come with me. I
want to think it over."
</p>

<p>
"But, dearest, I shall see you to-night?" he pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but please do not persuade me now."
</p>

<p>
Respecting her desire, he doffed his cap and stood
aside for her to pass, bowing low before her with all
the chivalry of his race, all the ardor of his youth, all
the devotion of his manhood in his look and attitude.
</p>

<p>
The sweetness of the present reality so far transcended
her sometime imagination of it that the girl,
on leaving him, walked away as if borne by seraph's
wings through the air of heaven. Yet there was a
note athwart her joy,&#8212;not exactly one of sadness or
of heaviness, but a feeling, as it were, of maidenly awe
before the bright vistas of happiness which had opened
before her eyes, in her lover's presence, in his love.
Unconsciously she put her hand to her face, as if the
sight dazzled her.
</p>

<p>
A little distance away Revere, having fastened the
boat, followed her up the hill. She did not look back,
but she could hear his feet upon the steps. He was
there, then. He was looking at her as he had looked
at her in the boat. He loved her. What had she
done to merit this?
</p>

<p>
She stopped on the porch by the chair where her
grandfather sat gazing at the ship and dreaming as
usual. She bent low and kissed him as she had never
kissed him before. He awoke from his reverie with a
start, half comprehending, and gazed from the girl
entering the door to Revere coming up the walk.
</p>

<p>
"You have been a long time, lad," he said, as the
latter stopped before him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir. We took luncheon together at the old
inn and rowed back slowly. Your granddaughter&#8212;I
shall have something to say to you in a day or
two, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," said the admiral, quietly. "I thought
so. But don't wait too many days. Days are as moments
to the young; to the aged they are as years."
</p>

<p>
That day Barry had not left the ship. With a long,
old-fashioned glass that was chief among his treasures,
which had belonged to the admiral, he had followed
the boat across the harbor. He had divined&#8212;by
what cunning who can say?&#8212;what had been said in
the pauses under the trees. He had waited and
watched for them until the lovers came back. He
knew it all. Twenty times during the period of their
stay upon the shore he had gone down to the locker
and taken out the letters.
</p>

<p>
And at last he had succumbed to the temptation.
The devil had won him in the end. Hidden away in
his corner of the old vessel, he opened the bundle of
letters and orders. And as he painfully deciphered
them, one by one, it all became clear to him. This
cursed officer had come to sell the ship over their
heads. He had stolen Emily's heart, and yet he was
engaged to be married to another woman. The letters
from Josephine Remington puzzled him; but as he
slowly blundered through them, with their casual references
to an engagement, with their quiet assumption
that all was understood between the two, Barry became
convinced that Revere was simply amusing himself
with the admiral's granddaughter.
</p>

<p>
And was he to stand idle, indifferent, impotent,
while these things were going on? Was the old ship
to be sold and broken up? His ship! His love, too!
Was that sweet flower of innocence to be rifled of the
chief treasure of her womanhood and he do nothing?
Was she to be robbed of her happiness, too, while he
was there? No, never!
</p>

<p>
His brain reeled under the pressure of his thoughts.
What should he do? What could he do? In what
way might he compass the destruction of this man?
Save the ship and save the girl, too!
</p>

<p>
Ah! Like to one of old in his blindness, there
flashed an idea into his mind, as he stood there with
the crumpled letters in his clinched hand. At first it
startled him. It was so bold; in a way it was so terrible.
But he had brooded too long to look at that
idea in more than one light. With the one thought
of revenge upon the man who he imagined intended
to sell the ship, and who would gain Emily Sanford, he
brooded upon the notion until it took entire possession
of him, and then, although it involved his own
destruction, he grimly prepared to put it in practice.

CHAPTER XIV
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">In the Shadow of the Ship</span>
</p>


<p>
The rest of the afternoon passed swiftly
enough for Revere, because he was
busy. He wrote a long letter to Josephine
Remington, telling her frankly
the whole situation: how he had met
this girl, how he had loved her, how he had struggled
against the feeling that had sprung up in his heart,
honorably intending to keep his engagement, but
each moment convinced him of the depth and fervor
of this sudden affection. How he had come to the
conclusion that it was not fair to bind her to a man
who, while he admired and respected her, while he
should ever hold her in the highest regard, did not,
and could not, love her.
</p>

<p>
He had written to her thus frankly that she might
break the engagement. He could not, he said, flatter
himself that she loved him, or that it meant much to
her; yet if he grieved her, he humbly begged her
pardon, and hoped that some day, when she truly
loved some one, she would find excuse for him.
</p>

<p>
It was fearfully hard to write such a letter, and as
he read it over it seemed almost brutal in its frankness.
Yet he reasoned that it were better to write it
as he had than to attempt to conceal the facts; still,
it was with many misgivings and thoroughly sick at
heart at the unfortunate plight in which he had involved
himself that he sealed it up.
</p>

<p>
The other letter was to the Secretary of the Navy.
Revere reported faithfully the condition of the ship,
estimated carefully what he thought she would be
worth as firewood,&#8212;for the materials in her were fit for
no other purpose,&#8212;and then frankly offered to buy her
himself for twice the value he had put upon her. In a
private letter, which he had enclosed in his official report,
the secretary being an old friend of his family,
he told why he wished to purchase the ship. He told
him about the admiral, and the old sailor, and the
admiral's granddaughter. He made him see very
clearly that it would kill the old man to have the ship
broken up, and, since he possessed ample means, he
wished to have the privilege of purchasing it himself and
saying nothing about it to the admiral, or to any one,&#8212;letting
it stand where it was as long as it would. As
a matter of fact, it would fall to pieces in a short time
he was certain, and the admiral need never know anything
about the transaction, provided the secretary
were willing.
</p>

<p>
If there was any doubt as to the accuracy of his
valuation of the ship, he suggested that another officer
could be sent to appraise her, and he stood ready to
pay twice the amount of the next appraisement for
the privileges of ownership. In fact, the matter
would best be done that way. It was a nice letter,
and he felt sure his request would be granted.
</p>

<p>
Revere felt much better when he had completed
these two letters. He felt that he could save the ship
for the old admiral, and that he could save his honor
as well by his tardy action. He gave the letters to
his man, directing him to mail the one to the Secretary
of the Navy, and get a horse and ride back to
his mother's summer home at Alexandria Bay, deliver
the other in person, and bring the answer to him immediately.
He could not hear too quickly from
Josephine.
</p>

<p>
The admiral retired early that evening,&#8212;was it from
a consideration of past experience, thought Revere,&#8212;so
the two lovers were left alone.
</p>

<p>
"Emily," said the young lieutenant, coming over
toward her as the door closed behind the old veteran.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, not here, I beg of you!" said the girl,
rising to her feet. "Come, let us go out into the
moonlight. Down to the old ship. It should be a
part&#8212;a witness&#8212;of our betrothal. I, too, have loved
it. The earliest recollections of my childhood are
about it. It has been a part of my life as well. Come,
let us go."
</p>

<p>
She extended her hand to him as she spoke. He
took it gravely, and the two stepped out of the house
and stood upon the porch. The moonlight streamed
across the old ship, standing lonely and still upon the
Point beneath them. The cracks and crannies, the
gaping seams of the broken, mouldering sides, the
evidences of decay, were hidden in the shadows cast
by the soft splendor.
</p>

<p>
They walked down to it and stopped in its shadow.
Black, solid, and terrible in the silver light it loomed
above their heads. They stood almost beneath it, and
it towered into the skies above them. A trick of the
imagination would have dowered it with spars covered
with clouds of snowy canvas, and launched it upon
the sea of dreams.
</p>

<p>
The girl still held the hand of the young officer.
He waited for her pleasure, something telling him he
should not wait in vain.
</p>

<p>
"I brought you here, Richard," she said, at last, very
gravely, "that the old ship might hear you say,"&#8212;the
words came from her in a faint whisper,&#8212;"that the
ship might hear you say&#8212;you&#8212;loved me. Here
I have stood often, gazing out upon the water, dreaming
and waiting. Waiting for you, Richard, dreaming
of you. And here you come to me and here&#8212;I give
myself to you."
</p>

<p>
She faced him as she spoke and took his other
hand. He stared at her in the shadow of the ship.
The little autumn breeze swept softly over their faces.
Slowly he bent his head toward her. She awaited
him, smiling faintly, her heart beating half fearfully.
It was so new and sweet. Then his lips met her own;
he kissed her, he swept her to his breast, he gathered
her in his arms. Her head lay upon his shoulder, her
face was upturned to his. Her eyes were light in the
darkness to him. The perfume of her breath enveloped
him. A faint, passionate sigh of joy and
content ineffable escaped her. He drank in the white,
exquisite perfection of feature so close to him; the
purity of her soul spoke there equally with the passion of her heart. She was his, his own; she loved
him, she gave herself to him! May God deal so with
him as he dealt with her!
</p>

<p>
"I love you, I love you!" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
Pity 'tis that there is no new word for each new
meeting and mating of human hearts in this old
world.
</p>

<p>
Pity 'tis that the words we say so lightly, that we
use so frequently of things of less, of little, moment,
should be the only ones we have with which to voice
the deepest feeling of our being. Yet when the hour
strikes, to each heart they come with the freshness of
a new revelation, with the assurance of an eternal
truth undiscovered until that hour. Never again
would Emily be so happy as in that supreme moment
of avowal and confession.
</p>

<p>
"I love you, I love you!"
</p>

<p>
It was only a whisper. She would have felt the
truth had he been voiceless.
</p>

<p>
"I love you, I love you!"
</p>

<p>
It was but a murmur that blended with the sigh of
the wind, that harmonized with the sound made by
the breeze as it swept through the cracks and crannies
of the ship, yet another listened, another heard.
</p>

<p>
Profanation to the royal arcanum of their hearts!
</p>

<p>
One had marked them descending the hill, one had
divined that they would stop by the ship, one had gone
down into the grim, black depths of the monster and
with his ear pressed against the riven side had heard,
and in the hearing had understood what he could not
see.
</p>

<p>
So despair, heart-break, envy, jealousy, raged a few
feet from love and joy and peace ineffable.
</p>

<p>
So in life it happens. Was there not a serpent in
the Garden of Eden?
</p>

<p>
As he heard the sound of lip on lip, the break of
kisses, and the murmur of caressing words, the man
listening could endure no more. He turned and
stumbled blindly away. Had it been mid-day he
could not have seen where he went.
</p>

<p>
The sound of his going startled Emily.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" she cried; "something moving on
the ship!"
</p>

<p>
They listened, but Barry had gone far enough away
by that time for them not to hear him more.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas nothing, dearest," answered Revere, holding
her tenderly to him; "a piece of timber, a
loosened plank, a tottering frame. The newest and
best of ships are full of strange sounds, much more
these old ones."
</p>

<p>
"Bit by bit it wears away," said the girl, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sweet, old things go, but new ones come,"
answered Revere. "Life ends, yes, but new life
begins. It begins for us. Come. We have told the
ship the story. Let us go back to the hill."
</p>

<p>
"Keep thou the secret, old ship," said Emily, fancifully,
yet half in earnest; "tell it not while thou
livest, and if thou must fall, let it perish with thee."
</p>

<p>
She bent and kissed the plank. Where she kissed
it Barry had listened. The whisper of love and the
oath of despair,&#8212;a few inches of sheathing alone
divided them.

</p>


<p>
"That kiss, sweetest," said Revere,
gravely, as they walked up the hill,
"has made the ship immortal in my
heart. It shall stand until it falls
away. I was sent here by the government
to sell the ship. It was to be destroyed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard!" she cried in sudden anxiety and
alarm at his words.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, love; say nothing of it to any one. It shall
not be."
</p>

<p>
"Who will prevent it?"
</p>

<p>
"I."
</p>

<p>
"You! But how?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall buy it myself and let it stand as long as it
will."
</p>

<p>
"How good you are!" she exclaimed, greatly relieved.
"But, Dick, are you rich enough to buy a
whole ship yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"My darling," he answered, "since you kissed me
I think I have the mines of Golconda at my command."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but kisses won't buy ships," returned the wise
maiden. "Seriously, Richard?"
</p>

<p>
"Seriously, dearest, I suppose I am rich enough to
buy anything I want; that is, anything in reason that
is buyable. No fortune could put a price upon you,
I am afraid."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Dick!" said the girl. "Are you as
rich as that?"
</p>

<p>
"I am of the opinion that I am," he said, somewhat
reluctantly; he could not exactly comprehend
why. "Does it disappoint you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I believe not," she answered, doubtfully. "I
never dreamed of such a thing, I'll admit. I always
thought we would have a little cottage somewhere&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"We?" joyfully.
</p>

<p>
"Of course. We. I was waiting for you, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, dearest, I hope you will become accustomed
to something larger than a cottage. Money has some
advantages, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt not I shall if you will teach me. Oh,
Dick, I am so happy! I feel so sorry for that other
girl."
</p>

<p>
"What other girl?" he asked, faintly conscience-smitten.
</p>

<p>
"Josephine, you know. The girl you saved."
</p>

<p>
Her words struck him like a blow. They brought
him to himself. He had to tell her the truth. They
were by this time sitting side by side on the gun-carriage
on the little platform overlooking the brow
of the hill.
</p>

<p>
"Emily, dearest," said Revere, desperately. He
hated to do it; he told himself that he was a fool to
say anything, yet her presence and her trust compelled
him. "I have something to confess to you. I
cannot allow a shadow of deceit to rest on our happiness
this heavenly night, and even though it hurts
you&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Dick," she said, as he lingered, reluctant
to speak, "whatever it may be. I think I have had
happiness enough to last a lifetime as it is; and you
love me, don't you? It is not that you do not?"
</p>

<p>
"Love you? I worship you!"
</p>

<p>
"Then nothing can matter much," she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"But I must say it," he persevered; "I am&#8212;I
was engaged to marry&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Josephine?" a note of terror in the exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," with great contrition.
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence. The girl shrank away
from him. She hid her face in her hands, but she did
not weep. That would come later. Was she not to
be happy, after all?
</p>

<p>
He felt so guilty and conscience-stricken that he
made no attempt to restrain her movement of avoidance,
although he longed to take her in his arms again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard, how could you?" she said at last,
the misery and reproach in her voice cutting him to
the heart.
</p>

<p>
"I could not help it."
</p>

<p>
It was the old answer that seems so weak, so futile,
so foolish, and yet the only answer that could be
given; a vague reply, and yet she comprehended.
</p>

<p>
"I've been a mean coward," he exclaimed. "But
at least I love you, and I could not help it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe that&#8212;that you love me, I mean,&#8212;but
you could have helped it," she answered,
faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I ought to have helped it," he admitted, in
honest misery; "but I love you, and before you it
was hard to be silent."
</p>

<p>
"But you loved the other girl before?"
</p>

<p>
"No, never, I swear to you!"
</p>

<p>
"Look me in the face, Richard."
</p>

<p>
She turned him about in the moonlight and gazed
at him keenly, passionately, hungrily almost. He
met her glance undaunted. The incubus of the secret
was lifted from him&#8212;he was another man, even
though still bound.
</p>

<p>
"Emily, I swear to you that my heart has never
beat quicker at the thought of her since I have known
her. Believe that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do believe," said the girl, trustingly, at last.
</p>

<p>
"It is true, and you may. It was an engagement
entered into as a sort of family affair, and I never
cared anything about it one way or the other. I
thought it would be rather pleasant&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, on my honor, until I met you; and then I
knew it could never be."
</p>

<p>
"You said you <i>were</i> engaged to her, Richard.
What do you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"As soon as I could after I had spoken to you
this afternoon I wrote to her, telling her the truth
about my love for you and giving her a chance to
break the engagement."
</p>

<p>
"Where is the letter?"
</p>

<p>
"It is gone."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose she will not break it?"
</p>

<p>
"She will, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Dick, I know that she loves you. I know she
won't give you up. Oh, my heart is breaking!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense; she doesn't love me at all!"
</p>

<p>
"No woman could help it who knew you as I do,"
decidedly.
</p>

<p>
"No one knows me as you do, dearest. To no
one have I ever shown my heart, myself, as I have
shown them to you. She must give me up; she shall!
I tell you I will marry no woman but you, no matter
what happens!"
</p>

<p>
"And I, Dick, will marry no one but you. But, oh,
the pity of it! Why didn't I know you before?"
</p>

<p>
"But you believe me, don't you, that I love you,
only you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I believe," mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"And you will trust me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose I will have to trust you," she
answered.
</p>

<p>
"But you won't do that merely because you have
to, will you?" pleaded the young man, coming nearer
to her.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said at last, faintly. "I will trust you because
I&#8212;I love you."
</p>

<p>
He suddenly swept her to his breast again and
kissed her once more. But she did not return his kiss,
and immediately thrust him away from her.
</p>

<p>
"Please do not do that again, Richard; at least not
yet," she murmured, as she resolutely disengaged herself
from his embrace. "Poor girl! you don't love
her. And now good-night. I must think&#8212;it's all so
strange&#8212;I don't know. We will talk over what is
best in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"But you love me still? You won't let this make
any difference, will you?" he pleaded, in deadly
anxiety, stretching out his hands to her.
</p>

<p>
"It won't make any difference in my love,&#8212;nothing
will ever change that," she answered, sadly; "but it
makes a great difference in my happiness."
</p>

<p>
Poor Emily! she was just learning that the beginning
of a woman's love is forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
In the oldest of Books is written, "It is not good
that man should be alone," and the saying is as true
as it is ancient. The human being who looks at
things through but one pair of eyes&#8212;his own&#8212;is apt
to receive distorted impressions, to see strange visions,
and to dream fearful dreams.
</p>

<p>
To be solitary is to go mad. Society is the preserver
and promoter of intelligence and all the virtues;
alas! of many of the vices as well. Men&#8212;ay, and
women, too&#8212;have tried to dispense with humanity,
seeking something higher. They have withdrawn themselves
from the world a while, and, far from the madding
crowd's ignoble strife, in the vast expanse of some
limitless desert, or upon some rough-ribbed Sinai's
rocky crest, in seclusion from the sound of tongues
and the war of men, have sought to draw near to
God.
</p>

<p>
And they have not found Him. Rather Satan has
entered into them and they have become victims of
diabolic obsession. For God is in the people. The
human touch conveys the divine. The attrition of
men is the outward force that makes character. Life
is to fit in and be a part of daily duty among common
men. So other and higher life is won.
</p>

<p>
Barry was a man, alone,&#8212;a madman now. Revere
had added the finishing touch by breaking in upon
the man's solitude. The admiral was becoming
only a daily duty to the sailor. Habit had almost
encysted his affection for his superior. As Emily had
approached womanhood she had drawn away from
Barry. He worshipped her from a greater and greater
distance, constantly increasing. And now that she
loved one of her own age and her own class, the
old man felt that she had almost vanished from his
sight. The last link that held him in touch with
humanity was breaking. Should he not strike while
there was time? Love was not for him, but hate is
everybody's. He should claim his portion.
</p>

<p>
The rotting ship was his mountain, his desert, his
hermitage. Its bare, gaunt timbers were his horizon.
He looked, he listened, he read again the letters, he
agonized, he broke, and was lost. And when the
devil came to him, under the guise of good to be
accomplished, he found a place ready, swept and
garnished for him.
</p>

<p>
Oh, poor, blind, possessed old sailor!

CHAPTER XVI

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">A Cloud on the Horizon</span>
</p>


<p>
A quickened conscience is not the best
of soporifics, and Revere was a long
time in getting to sleep. The miserable
situation into which he had
plunged himself, however, was alleviated
by the consciousness, of which nothing could
deprive him, that Emily loved him. And he persuaded
himself that when a girl, such as he fancied
her, loved, she loved forever. Which was true.
There was much comfort for him in the idea. He
could not, however, take the joy that should have
been his in the realization of this glorious fact until
his affairs with Josephine had been adjusted. As for
Emily, she, too, mingled her grief at the pre-engagement
with joy in Richard's love, but with less confidence
in its permanence; and, like his, her hours
were sorely troubled.
</p>

<p>
The next morning she carefully avoided seeing him
except in the presence of others, and the topics they
were both dying to discuss remained unbroached until
a messenger from the village, a servant of the inn,
delivered a note to Revere. The admiral and Emily
were on the porch with him when the missive was
handed to him. Barry was busy at something down
on the ship. He had reported to the admiral early
in the morning that there were some repairs that he
wished to make which would probably take him the
whole of the day. However, nobody, unless it was
the admiral, missed him, in which lay the pity of it all.
</p>

<p>
Revere started with surprise as he glanced at the
address on the envelope.
</p>

<p>
"Why!" he exclaimed, involuntarily, "it is from
my mother! Can it be possible that she is here?"
</p>

<p>
"A lady guv it to me to bring to you," said the
messenger. "She come to the tavern late last night,
an' said as how she didn't want to disturb you until
mornin'."
</p>

<p>
"Your mother!" exclaimed Emily. "Why&#8212;what
can she&#8212;how does it&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
As she spoke Richard tore open the letter and
glanced at its contents.
</p>

<p>
"She has heard some garbled account of my adventure,"
he said to Emily, "and she was worried, and
has come over here to see me. That's all."
</p>

<p>
"Did she come alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Er&#8212;no; not exactly."
</p>

<p>
"Who is with her?" with dawning suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Remington."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" with great surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must go to her at once, I suppose," said
Revere, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," coldly and disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
"My lad," said the admiral, "the inn is but a poor
place for ladies of quality and gentlefolk to stay.
Present my compliments to your mother and her
young friend, and beg them to honor me by accepting
our hospitality while they abide in this latitude.
Tell them, I beg of you, that my age and infirmities
prevent me from extending the invitation in person,
but that my granddaughter will call upon them later
and invite them in my behalf."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, grandfather! I&#8212;I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"My mother will be delighted to receive Miss
Emily," broke in Richard, quickly. "I have no
doubt that her plans contemplate remaining here
longer than a day, and I think she will be glad to accept
your hospitality. She will be honored, I am
sure. Meanwhile, I must go. May I have your boat,
Miss Emily? I suppose that is the quickest way to
the village?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Mr. Revere."
</p>

<p>
"And will you not walk down to the landing with
me?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated, longing yet reluctant.
</p>

<p>
"Of course she will. Go with him, Emily," said
the admiral, decisively.
</p>

<p>
"Richard," said the girl, as soon as they were out
of earshot of the porch, "they have come about that
letter."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Revere, dejectedly, forgetting in
his confusion that they had arrived the night before;
"I suppose so. I didn't think it possible that it could
have reached them by this time. My man must have
made good time. Oh, dear; what shall I do? Was
ever innocent man placed in so miserable a position?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard, you are involved innocently&#8212;you
say you could not help loving me&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't."
</p>

<p>
"But you had no right to involve me, sir. But
there, I won't reproach you. She won't give you up;
you will have to keep your word, that's all."
</p>

<p>
She spoke with infinite sadness.
</p>

<p>
"You have loved me, anyway, and that's a great
deal. I ought to be thankful for that, I suppose," she
continued.
</p>

<p>
They were sheltered now from the observation of
every one,&#8212;but Barry from the ship,&#8212;and she put
her handkerchief up to her eyes and sobbed out the
following in broken sentences:
</p>

<p>
"I've thought it out all night long, Richard. You
saved that girl's life; she has a claim on you. I know
she loves you deeply; and of course she won't give you
up. I&#8212;I wouldn't myself," she wailed. "I hope
you will be very hap&#8212;hap&#8212;happy with her and&#8212;you
will forget all about this. Oh, Dick, Dick!"
</p>

<p>
"My heavens! Emily, you nearly drive me distracted!
I tell you I couldn't be happy with an arch-angel
if she were not you! She must give me up!
She shall! I don't really suppose she will hesitate a
moment. Why, if she could see you she would know
in a glance that I could not help falling in love with
you."
</p>

<p>
"Probably she thinks she's as nice as I am," she
continued, through her tears. "She would look upon
me as an ignorant little country girl. She would
wonder how you could possibly fall in love with me.
I wonder about it myself. You do love me, don't
you?" anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do. I have told you a thousand
times, and I mean it! I mean it more every time I
tell you, and I want to tell you more every time I see
you. I won't marry Josephine Remington, and that's
all there is about it!"
</p>

<p>
"You must!" decisively.
</p>

<p>
"If you say that again, Emily, we will quarrel right
here," sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps that would be best. If we quarrelled it
would be easier to break it off."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we won't quarrel, then. But what I am
going to do I cannot say. I'll just tell the truth and
stick to it. I wish&#8212;oh, I wish&#8212;they hadn't come!
I do not want to see her at all."
</p>

<p>
"But you must go, and go right away!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well. The sooner it is over the better,
perhaps. Good-by, Emily."
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, Richard," heartbrokenly.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you kiss me good-by? You have not
kissed me since last night. You have not let me see
you alone this long morning," reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Emily, with sad decision; "I do
not believe I shall kiss you. We are not yet engaged,
and you may not belong to me, after all. I think I
would better not."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right, then," with a savage simulation of
unconcern.
</p>

<p>
"You are not angry, are you?" timidly.
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not angry; but I am awfully&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"You see I am afraid it's the end and another kiss
would make it&#8212;harder."
</p>

<p>
She spoke slowly, with a note of interrogation in her
voice. For answer he clasped her in his arms and kissed
her fervently again and again. She remained weakly
struggling for a moment, but finally returned his
caresses. Presently, however,&#8212;after she had been well
kissed, by the way,&#8212;her determination came back to
her. She burst from his arms with a violent effort,
exclaiming,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"There, go! And I suppose you will be with them
all day?"
</p>

<p>
"I will come back to you as soon as I can get
away."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dick, I suppose I will have to go over there
in the afternoon and invite them here. What will
your mother think of me? I don't believe I ever
met a high-born, high-bred lady in my life. I wouldn't
know what to do."
</p>

<p>
"Do just as you always do; be yourself; and if my
experience is any criterion, she will adore you as I do.
Good-by."

<span class="sc">Freed!</span>
</p>


<p>
In the same little parlor of the inn in which he
had lunched with Emily the day before, Revere
awaited the entrance of his mother and Josephine.
His mother entered first and immediately
clasped him in fond embrace.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard!" she exclaimed, tearfully; "I have
been so miserable about you! You never said a word
about the gravity of your accident, and I only learned
about it accidentally. You are not suffering, are you?
You have sustained no serious consequences?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mother dear; I'm all right. In fact, I feel
better than I have felt for six months. It really did
me good. It was awfully good of you to come to see
about me, though. I should have written and told you
all about it and assured you that nothing serious was
the matter, but I thought it would alarm you if I did;
if I dwelt upon it too fully, that is. I'm very glad to
see you; but there was no real necessity for your
coming."
</p>

<p>
"Richard," she answered, hesitatingly, with a long
sigh of regret, "I did not come only on that account.
To be perfectly frank with you, Josephine&#8212;you have
not yet greeted her."
</p>

<p>
She stopped abruptly. He turned and faced Josephine,
who had stood constrainedly in the door-way,
apparently an unwilling witness of the meeting.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said to her; "how do you do, Josephine?
I'm awfully glad to see you."
</p>

<p>
He had hitherto always signalized meetings of this
kind by kissing her, generally upon the forehead or
cheek. With a vivid recollection of his present situation,
however, he hesitated awkwardly, and then concluded
that it would be better to act as if nothing had
happened. But to his great surprise the objection
came from the young lady herself. As if she had
divined something of his mental attitude, she drew
back her head and thrust out her hand. He took it,
feeling very much embarrassed, yet greatly relieved.
</p>

<p>
"What a greeting," said his mother, "between&#8212;but
I forget. Josephine has something to say to you,
Richard. She has made a decision which is a source
of lasting grief to me, and will be to all who know
you. I am sure it will be a great shock to you. Prepare
yourself, my poor boy."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you get my letter, Josephine?" said
Richard, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"No; I didn't receive any letter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then, you didn't&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't what?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, er&#8212;nothing. What was it you wanted to
say to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Richard," said the girl, "I may as well be frank
with you. I&#8212;&#8212;" She hesitated and turned her face
away. "I want to break our engagement."
</p>

<p>
"Want to break our engagement!" he exclaimed,
dazed at this development. "Why&#8212;I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, honestly; "frankly, I do not
believe that I care enough for you to marry you."
</p>

<p>
"But, Josephine&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; I know what you would say. I thought
I loved you; but since I have come to know&#8212;Mr.
Van Dorn, I am sure&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Josephine Remington, you don't mean to tell me
that you have thrown me over for Charlie Van Dorn?
Why, he&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Richard, don't say another word! I love Mr.
Van Dorn, and he loves me, and I have promised to
be his wife," with great dignity.
</p>

<p>
"Great heavens!" answered Richard, trying desperately
to keep his happiness at this announcement
out of his voice and out of his face; and yet he had to
confess that he felt extremely annoyed at being rejected
in this summary manner for a man who he
conceived to be in every way inferior to himself.
</p>

<p>
He rejoiced, certainly; but the situation had elements
of unpleasantness. For a moment or two these
had predominated, but as he realized that he was free,
he could hardly keep from shouting for joy. Indeed,
he felt that his face would betray his secret, and he instinctively
turned away from the two women, who were
intently watching him, and covered it with his hand
as he did so.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard!" cried Josephine, contritely, "I'm
so sorry; I didn't think you cared so much. I thought
you felt as I do about the engagement,&#8212;only that it
was an agreed thing, and everybody more or less expected
it,&#8212;not that we loved each other very much&#8212;I'm
so sorry."
</p>

<p>
"My poor boy!" said his mother, coming up and
laying her hand tenderly on his bowed head; "this is
nearly as great a disappointment to me as it must be
to you, although, of course, my grief cannot be like
yours. Josephine, why didn't you wait a little longer?
And in his weak state, too!"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Revere, smiling&#8212;they thought
him smiling bravely, by the way!&#8212;"I dare say I shall
get over it; and if Josephine really loves Charlie Van
Dorn, who is a splendid fellow, of course it is very
much better that she should tell me frankly than feel
that she must remain bound by an engagement in
which her heart does not enter. Let us say no more
about it. I will take my medicine like a man," he
continued, mendaciously; "and I congratulate you,
Josephine, on your pluck. I presume that I may kiss
you now, just as I have done before," he said, touching
his lips to her forehead as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Richard. But I am sure they were never
very lover-like kisses at best."
</p>

<p>
"Not like Van Dorn's, eh!" said Richard, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Richard, how can you jest about so serious a
subject?" exclaimed his mother. "Poor boy!" she
said aside to Josephine; "I fear his nerves are shattered."
</p>

<p>
"They are, mother, they are," exclaimed Richard,
rapturously, giving her a bear-like hug; "but it's all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Then, you don't care so very much, after all?" said
Josephine, in her turn disappointed at the equanimity,
not to say levity, with which her quondam lover received
the news of her engagement to another man.
</p>

<p>
"Care? Of course I care! There, don't say anything
more about it. Mother, did they tell you that
my life was saved by a&#8212;er&#8212;a young woman?"
</p>

<p>
Ah, Richard, where was Barry then?
</p>

<p>
"A young woman!" exclaimed his mother, peering
at him through her lorgnette in her very best Boston
manner. "What sort of a person is she?"
</p>

<p>
"She is not a person at all, mother," he answered,
hotly and inconsequentially; "she is a charming
young girl, the granddaughter of one of the most distinguished
officers in the United States navy. And
she is as beautiful as she is brave and good."
</p>

<p>
"And who may this distinguished man be?" asked
his mother, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Admiral Charles Stewart, of the <i>Constitution</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" she exclaimed. "Is he yet alive? I
remember hearing of him when I was a little girl."
</p>

<p>
"He is very much alive and his granddaughter
lives with him over yonder," he answered, pointing
out of the window across the bay toward the old white
house embowered in the trees on Ship House Point.
"That is his home, and he bade me say to you that
he would be honored to have you and Josephine accept
his hospitality while you are here. He begs to
be excused for his apparent discourtesy in not coming
to invite you in person, but he is unable to leave the
house, he is so old and feeble. His granddaughter,
however, will call this afternoon and extend the invitation,
if it will be agreeable to you."
</p>

<p>
"I do not think we should stand on ceremony,
Josephine, under the circumstances, and we will go
ourselves and call upon the admiral immediately," said
Mrs. Revere. "I should like to see this young lady
and thank her for Richard. How shall we get there,
Dick?"
</p>

<p>
"I will row you over if you will allow me. There
is a road by land, but this is a quicker and pleasanter
way."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, Richard; I think we would better go
by land. I presume you can get some sort of a carriage.
I confess I am not fond of boats at best, and
since you were wrecked in the <i>Josephine</i> I have a
horror of venturing on them."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, mother; I will make all the arrangements,
and meanwhile go back to the admiral and tell
him to expect you."
</p>

<p>
"Do so," said his mother; "we will go and make
ready. Come, Josephine."
</p>

<p>
"Presently," answered Miss Remington; "I wish
to speak to Dick a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Richard," said his whilom fianc&#233;e, when they
were alone, "are you in love with that girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, er&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Answer me honestly!"
</p>

<p>
"I think it is very likely that I shall be, Josephine,"
he responded at last. "You see, since you have
thrown me over I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Dick Revere, I believe you are in love with her
now; I don't believe you care a single bit whether I
throw you over or not."
</p>

<p>
"Care!" exclaimed Revere. "I care immensely,
I want to assure you, Josephine. But I really do not
see, since you have thrown me over, that you have
any right to object to my falling in love with anybody
else, have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well," said Josephine, petulantly; "no
doubt what you say is true; but one thing is
certain: I am just as anxious to see that girl as your
mother is."
</p>

<p>
"Just about as anxious, I suppose," laughed
Revere, "as I should be to see Charlie Van Dorn if
I hadn't seen him until I am sick of the sight of
him!" he said, meanly. "Well, prepare yourself, Miss
Josephine Remington; you will see something charming
when you do see 'that girl'! Good-by!"

CHAPTER XVIII
</p>

<p class="head">
"<span class="sc">But yet a Woman</span>"
</p>


<p>
Revere had pulled in many an Academy
boat race. He had stroked his cutter
many a time when a cadet, but he never
put so much vim and force into the oars
as he did that morning. In an incredibly
short time he was at the landing-place. Forgetful
of his condition, he bounded up the hill as if he had
been a boy. Emily and the admiral were still on
the porch. Emily was looking very subdued and sad,
and there was a world of entreaty in the agonized
glance she cast upon him. His radiant face gave her
delightful assurance, which his words turned into
ecstasy. He chose a novel way of announcing his
news to her.
</p>

<p>
"Admiral Stewart," he said, precipitately, as he
stopped panting, "I have the honor to ask you for the
hand of your granddaughter, Miss Emily. I love her
and I&#8212;I have reason to believe that she&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated and looked at the blushing girl, who
had sprung to her feet at his first word, and now stood
poised as if for flight.
</p>

<p>
It was all right, then; he was released, he was free!
She knew that he would never have spoken to her
grandfather unless he could honorably do so. Her
heart that had been so heavy was leaping in her
bosom at the gladsome thought. Free to love her,
free to take her for his own! The other girl had
given him up, then. How could she do it? But she
had! And he was hers now! She must go away,
though, while the two men talked it over.
</p>

<p>
She turned swiftly toward the entrance to the
house. The admiral, wide awake instantly, turned
and caught her by the hand. Escape cut off, she
dropped on her knees by the old man's side. What
answer would her grandfather make? What would
he say or do?
</p>

<p>
"Child," he said at last, fondly looking down at her,
"is this true?"
</p>

<p>
"True that he loves me, grandfather? He&#8212;he
says so, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe him, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I&#8212;yes, sir; I think I do."
</p>

<p>
"And I do, too, Emily. If ever I heard truth
ring in a man's voice, I hear it now. But this is not
all. Do you love him, daughter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grandfather," she whispered, "I'm afraid&#8212;I
do."
</p>

<p>
She hid her face in her hands on his knee, and the
old man laid his hand softly on her head, murmuring
words of prayer and blessing. As Revere watched
them he thought they made a perfect pair.
</p>

<p>
"Are you able to support a wife, lad?" asked the
veteran, at last, as he stroked the sunny hair of his
granddaughter.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; amply able."
</p>

<p>
"You have something more than a lieutenant's pay,
then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; I have a private fortune of my own."
</p>

<p>
"And your mother?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not told her yet, sir; but she is coming
to call upon you immediately, and then I shall do
so. I have no doubt what her answer will be;
although, whatever it be, I am a man in years and
my own master, and&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, lad, a man's never wholly his own master in
the presence of a good mother, and I'd have no child
of mine coldly welcomed into any family. We shall
see what your mother says. If she be content, I shall
be very glad. You have no other tie?"
</p>

<p>
Emily lifted her head and looked at Revere as this
question was put. There were tears in her eyes and
her heart almost ceased beating. She was sure of the
answer, yet she longed to hear his specific reply.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," answered the young man, boldly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard!" exclaimed Emily; "and Josephine!"
</p>

<p>
"Josephine!" said the old man; "who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"A connection of my family, sir, who has just announced
to me her engagement to an estimable young
man of our acquaintance."
</p>

<p>
"Richard," said Emily, springing to her feet, "you
don't mean it?"
</p>

<p>
"I do. Will you kiss me now, Emily?"
</p>

<p>
Forgetful of the old man, she sprang into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Children, children!" said the admiral, smiling indulgently; "you are in a great hurry, it seems to me.
Ah, well, I remember when I was a lad, so many
years ago, I was in a hurry, too. Now I wait. Indifferently
I wait. It cannot be much longer, and yet,
for your sake, dear child, I was loath to go. Now,
please God,&#8212;and your mother, young sir,&#8212;the child
will be cared for. We can go now, I and the ship. I
trust I will be able to leave you in love's hands; in
the hands of a gentleman and a sailor, an officer of
the navy of the United States,&#8212;your mother consenting,
my lad,&#8212;that is as I would have it. Revere,
may God bless you as you deal tenderly and lovingly
with this daughter of my old, old age."
</p>

<p>
"And may God judge me, sir, if I do not so,"
answered Richard, solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"This kiss is for you, grandfather," answered the
happy Emily, turning to him.

CHAPTER XIX
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">The Usual Course</span>
</p>


<p>
They were together on the gun-platform
once more, Emily and Revere.
She sat on the gun-carriage and he
leaned against the parapet by her side.
He held a fold of her dress in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Dick," she said, "tell me all about it.
Was she vexed when she received your letter?"
</p>

<p>
"My darling, she has not seen it. She and mother
started before my man got there. He is probably
bringing it back here now. As good luck would have
it, she has fallen in love with a certain Charles Van
Dorn. He's rather a poor stick, too, I think."
</p>

<p>
"She must be a strange girl, Dick, to fall in love
with anybody else when you were around."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know. At any rate, she did fall in
love, and she came here of her own motion to break
the engagement."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder how she will feel when she gets the
letter?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, dearest, I thought, under the circumstances,
I wouldn't give it to her."
</p>

<p>
"Not give it to her?" cried the girl, with sudden
promptness and decision; "indeed you will give her
that letter, sir! She shall know you loved me before
she released you, and that you were going to break
the engagement yourself. I won't have her think for
a moment that I just got you because she threw you
over. Not give her the letter, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Emily," said Revere, deprecatingly, greatly
surprised at this outburst; "you see I thought I
would save her the&#8212;er&#8212;humiliation, you know, of
being rejected by a man."
</p>

<p>
"And you will inflict on me, Richard Revere, the
humiliation of letting her think that I only have you
because she didn't want you! That I&#8212;&#8212;" furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear; you know perfectly well that's
different. If she has half an eye, as soon as she sees
us together, she will know that I love you desperately
as I never loved her. She is a bright girl."
</p>

<p>
"Bright! I don't think so!" contemptuously. "She
is very stupid to give you up; but I'm glad she is&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I should think she would be awfully sorry to know
that a man had broken his engagement with her, and
that's why I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Revere, I believe you are sorry yourself, after
all! I believe you are half in love with her still!"
reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Emily, you know that's nonsense. Why, I
felt so joyful when she said she was in love with
that Van Dorn, that I had to turn away my face for
fear she would see how enraptured I was."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell her frankly, honestly, right
then, that you were pleased with it; that you were
engaged to me; that you had broken the engagement before? It was your duty,&#8212;your duty to me.
You failed me; you failed me before. I can't trust
you." Most unkindly and unjustly spoken words were
these, indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Emily, my dear child&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a child, and don't you call me one! I
am a woman, though you treat me like a child, and
I'm not dear to you, either! You are sacrificing me
to that other girl," bitterly, tearfully, but with great
determination.
</p>

<p>
Revere was nonplussed by the revelation of these
essentially feminine characteristics in Emily's otherwise
charming personality. He did not know what
to do or how to answer her in his bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to give her that letter or not?" she
asked, insistently, after a pause which he appeared
unable to break unaided.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said at last, but very reluctantly, "I
suppose if you insist upon it I must; but frankly, I
think it would be better not to do so. I do not believe
it is right."
</p>

<p>
"Is there something in it you don't want me to
know?" suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing; absolutely nothing. I told you all I said
as near as I can remember. It's a matter of principle,
Emily. I think you are wrong, dearest. I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir; then you will sacrifice me, will you, to
your principle? Very well, Mr. Revere, understand
one thing: if you do not give that letter to her as
soon as you get it back, you do not get me. I will
not have any one think I am a second choice."
</p>

<p>
"But, Emily&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say anything more to me!" she flashed out.
"I never was so angry in my life! Perhaps you are
tired of me," impatiently and proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you are tired of me," answered Richard,
shortly, his own quick temper having at last reached
the outbreaking point. "I think you are very cruel
indeed, to want to hurt this poor girl's feelings, and I
do not see why you are crying now, either," he added,
as Emily, under the stimulus of this reproach, the
force of which she recognized, put her handkerchief
to her face and burst into tears. "It seems to me
you have entirely the best of the game. My engagement
is broken; I am free to love you, and I do,
and to marry you, and I hope to. You have me," he
went on with unconscious egotism; "that ought to
content you. Josephine will know, as soon as she sees
us together, that I love you," he continued, sharply,
"and that's enough."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what she would think of your love if she
saw us together now," wailed Emily. "I don't care
what you say; it's humiliating to me; it's brutal treatment.
You say I have everything. You say I ought
to be satisfied with you. I'm not! So, there!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Revere, coldly; "I will leave you
to think it over, and then, if you insist, I shall give her
the letter, and you will be sorry for it as long as you
live."
</p>

<p>
"I won't!" determinedly.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will, anyway," with equal determination.
</p>

<p>
"I never dreamed you could be so rude and so
unkind to me," she sobbed. "I am sorry that&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you would like to break our engagement,
Miss Sanford?" coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as you please, Mr. Revere," with well-simulated
indifference.
</p>

<p>
"There is a carriage coming up the drive," he remarked,
glad of a diversion when they had reached
this uncomfortable point in the conversation. "My
mother and Josephine are in it."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" exclaimed the girl, secretly glad of the
interruption, too; "and they will see that I have been
crying!"
</p>

<p>
"As to the engagement?" continued Richard, doggedly;
but Emily started suddenly to her feet and ran
up to the house, leaving his question unanswered.
He followed her moodily and gloomily, feeling very
low in spirits as well as very much annoyed.
</p>

<p>
Barry had been busy all day about the ship, but he
had not been too much occupied to see Revere and
Emily whenever they were within range, and he had
kept close watch upon them. Too far away to determine
what was going on by the gun, he could at least
see that the girl was weeping, that she was unhappy,
and he realized that she had left Revere in anger and
disappointment. The young officer was beginning
early to torment her, to break her heart,&#8212;so the old
sailor surmised. If Barry needed any more inspiration,
that was enough. But he was already sufficiently
determined upon his plan, and he went back
to his work with the fury of desperation renewed.

CHAPTER XX
</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="sc">Rivals Meeting</span>
</p>


<p>
Revere reached the house just as the carriage
drew up before the door. He
assisted his mother and Josephine to
descend therefrom, and the two ladies
walked up the steps to the porch and
were formally presented to the old admiral.
</p>

<p>
In honor of the occasion, for, as he said, he did not
often have the privilege of entertaining guests of such
distinction, the veteran had dressed himself in the old
uniform in which he had fought his battles. The lace
was faded and tarnished, and the coat hung loosely
enough about his thin and shrunken figure; but the
ancient uniform seemed to mark the age of the old
man, typifying that past, forever gone, of which he had
been so splendid a figure. The huge chapeau, the
high stock, the ruffled shirt, the tight breeches, and
the half-boots might have incited laughter in the irreverent;
but to Richard and his mother, and to Josephine
as well, they seemed entirely appropriate.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a  name="formally"><img src="images/004.jpg" alt="They were formally presented to the old admiral" width="352" height="500"></a></div>
<p class="caption">They were formally presented to the old admiral
</p>

<p>
And the admiral's manner&#8212;gracious, courteous&#8212;was
quite in accord with his garments. It was distinctly
old-fashioned in its gallantry and exquisite in its deference.
Mrs. Revere, a grand dame herself, was evidently charmed with him; while on her own part she
made a not less favorable impression upon the old
gentleman, who, in his day, had always mingled with
the best. It was long since the admiral had been
in the society of such a woman, and he keenly delighted
in the little conversation that ensued. Josephine,
too, came in for a due share of attention, and,
as any young girl would have done, she fell promptly
in love with this charming old sailor.
</p>

<p>
The talk naturally enough turned upon Richard's
adventure, and his mother could not say enough in
her endeavor to express her gratitude and thankfulness
for his rescue. The servant had announced that Miss
Emily would be out presently, and the two women
waited with unconcealed interest for her appearance.
</p>

<p>
Some natural anxiety filled the heart of Revere.
He had no doubt as to the qualities of the woman he
loved, but he wondered how she would strike his
mother. She certainly was not like the young Boston
women of his mother's social circle. Just as high
bred as, and, in his mind, infinitely more beautiful
than, Josephine Remington, yet she was of so entirely
different a type that he could not restrain some misgivings.
Of course he meant to marry Emily under
any circumstances, and he had no fear, in spite of the
quarrel which had temporarily overcast their happiness,
but that she would marry him as well; but he
was the only son of his mother, and it would be
pleasanter all around if she should be attracted to
Emily and be willing to welcome her within the precincts
of her exclusive family.
</p>

<p>
He could see that she was delighted with the admiral,
as, indeed, who could fail to be? When the old
man informed her that he had known her husband's
father intimately, and that the old commodore had
cruised with him when he was a lieutenant; and when
he said pleasant things about the commodore, who
was deservedly held in high esteem in the family, and
told her some charming little anecdotes illustrating
his courage and ability, her heart was quite won.
</p>

<p>
The moments passed in pleasant conversation,
therefore, until the quick ear of Richard recognized a
light footfall in the hall. The door opened and Emily
stepped out on the porch. With the bright sunlight
of the afternoon falling upon her as she stood, clad in
a simple white dress, against the dark background of
the closed room, seen through the door-way, she made
so charming a picture of virginal loveliness that he
could scarcely repress a cry of admiration and delight.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of the opening of the door, Mrs.
Revere turned and critically surveyed the girl through
her lorgnette, and criticism at once gave place to approbation.
The admiral instantly rose, and as Emily
diffidently stepped toward him,&#8212;poor girl, it was
quite an ordeal to her, this meeting,&#8212;he took her
by the hand and presented her in due and ancient
form to his two guests, bowing low, with the grace
of a finished gentleman in spite of his age, as he
did so.
</p>

<p>
The dress the girl wore, while of the finest material,
was decidedly old-fashioned in its cut,&#8212;a fact
both women had been quick to notice; but when
she accompanied the admiral's bow by involuntarily
dropping a sweeping courtesy, after a fashion much
older than her dress, which went back almost to the
days of her grandfather's uniform, in fact,&#8212;for he
had taught her how to do it,&#8212;the effect was altogether
charming. A little exclamation broke from
the lips of the older woman. The lorgnette dropped
from her hand, and, instead of shaking hands formally,
as she had anticipated, Mrs. Revere rose and took
the girl in her arms.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, "how can I thank you for
saving my boy's life? Why, I cannot believe that you
did it! You do not look&#8212;you are so&#8212;forgive an old
woman&#8212;so daintily beautiful, I don't understand
where you got the strength to&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"She did it, though, mother," interrupted Richard,
joyfully, delighted at the turn of affairs.
</p>

<p>
"And she did it well," added the admiral, proudly;
"no one could have done it better."
</p>

<p>
"It was nothing, madam," said Emily, blushing at
these tributes; "I mean&#8212;Captain Barry did the most
of it&#8212;did it all, in fact. I only steered the boat
and held on to&#8212;Mr. Revere. Anybody could have
done it."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody but you did, though," said Richard,
promptly; "and if you had not been here, Miss Emily,
I should have ended all my cruising then."
</p>

<p>
"I think it was a most splendid action, Miss Sanford,"
said Josephine, warmly, "and as an old friend
of Richard I want to thank you, too."
</p>

<p>
"And this Captain Barry of whom you spoke,"
asked Mrs. Revere. "Where is he? I should like to
thank him also. Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Just a common sailor, madam, a bo's'n's mate,
long attached to my fortunes, and his father before
him. Worthy men, both," answered the admiral.
"He has been busy with the ship all day, but you
will see him presently, doubtless. He has been trying
to patch the old hulk up so that it may last a little
longer. He watches over it as he watches over me&#8212;and
my granddaughter. I sometimes think the ship
and he and I will go together, and I have been greatly
anxious as to what would become of this child then."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Revere was not given to impulsive action.
She was generally very self-contained, and usually
carefully considered what she said before she spoke,
but on this occasion she answered instantly,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Your granddaughter will never want a friend so
long as I live, admiral, and I shall be happy, indeed,
if I can repay some of the debt I owe her for Richard
in that way."
</p>

<p>
"Mother," said Richard, "I have something to say
to you. Admiral, you will pardon me if I ask Miss
Emily to take Miss Josephine into the house for a few
moments? No, sir; don't you go, please," he continued,
as the admiral made a motion to rise; "I
want you to hear, too."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, certainly, my lad. Emily, show Miss
Remington the treasures of your room, the model of
the <i>Susquehanna</i>&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"And the sword of the <i>Constitution</i>," interrupted
Richard; "that is the rarest treasure of them all."
</p>

<p>
"Come, then, Miss Remington," said Emily, extending
her hand to Josephine, "since we are dismissed."
</p>

<p>
Josephine instantly divined the meaning of Richard's
request. She shot a glance at him of mingled amusement
and annoyance, and found time to whisper as
she passed him standing by the door, which he had
opened for them,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"You do love her, then? Traitor! Well, I do not
wonder."
</p>

<p>
This was certainly magnanimous in her, yet she
was not particularly happy over the situation. Not
that she loved Revere, but a woman never forgives the
defection of an old admirer. Although she may have
been married for twenty years, when her sometime
lover follows her example, she always feels that it is
an evidence of masculine depravity and disloyalty.
</p>

<p>
However, Josephine could not justly reproach him
in view of her declared affection for Charles Van Dorn.
Yet he might have had the decency to wait a little
longer, she thought, somewhat bitterly, as she left the
porch. She was a generous girl, though, and had a
good heart. When they were alone, she slipped her
arm around Emily's waist, which was an unusual and
remarkable familiarity under any circumstances on
her part, and whispered in her ear,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, do you love him very much?"
</p>

<p>
"I&#8212;we quarrelled a few minutes ago about&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"About me, I'll warrant," shrewdly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," shamefacedly.
</p>

<p>
"You knew he was engaged to me, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; he told me so."
</p>

<p>
"And you knew the engagement was broken this
morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is nothing to quarrel about. Tell me,
now, honestly, do you love him very much?"
</p>

<p>
"More than anything under the sun," said Emily,
burying her face on Josephine's shoulder; "don't you
love him yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"I? Not a bit," laughed the older girl. "Oh, I
mean, yes, of course, a great deal. I like and admire
him immensely; but, you see, I happen to love&#8212;somebody
else."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand how you could love anybody
else after having been engaged to Richard. Are you
sure you don't?" ingenuously.
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly sure," complacently.
</p>

<p>
"And you are not giving him up for my sake?"
</p>

<p>
"Child, I had never a thought of you when I gave
him up. I did it because I loved somebody else, and
that's all. I would never have done for Dick, anyway;
but you, I think, will suit him exactly. I hope
you will be very happy, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think his mother&#8212;&#8212;?" anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure of that, too," answered Josephine, reassuringly.
"We are going to be great friends, I
know."
</p>

<p>
"I never had a friend,&#8212;a girl friend, that is,"&#8212;returned
Emily; "I have missed one so much. You
can't confide everything to your grandfather and a
sailor-man like Captain Barry, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I should think not," laughed Josephine. "And
I shall be so glad to be friends with you."
</p>

<p>
"And are you sure you do not love Dick?" doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure of it," decidedly.
</p>

<p>
"It is so very hard for me to believe that, you
know; I do not see how you could help it,"
innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Wait until you see Charlie&#8212;Mr. Van Dorn, I
mean."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure that would make no difference," returned
Emily, confidently.

<p>
"Mother," said Richard, as the three
were left alone, "I will be entirely
brief and frank with you. I love
Emily Sanford. It is a sudden feeling,
I grant you, but I am sure none
the less deep and abiding for that. I have reason to
think that she loves me as well. This morning, after
I came back from the inn, freed from the engagement
by Josephine's own act, I asked the admiral if
he would give her to me."
</p>

<p>
"I said, madam," interrupted the admiral, with
natural pride, "that I would not withhold my consent
provided the match were agreeable to yourself.
I have reared and educated my granddaughter principally
myself, and, naturally, she lacks many things
which, I trust, she may easily acquire upon the good
foundation I have endeavored to give her; but she
has lived in an atmosphere of love and devotion
in this house, and I would not have her an unwelcome
intruder in any family. As to her family,
madam, it is my own, and I think," he added with
simple dignity, "that there is none better in the Republic.
She will not come to your son portionless&#8212;there is a tidy little fortune for her after I am gone,
and that will be soon, certainly. Of her personal
qualities I may not speak. She is most dear to me.
For the last twenty years of my life she has been
everything to me. No one could have a more dutiful
child, nor one sweeter and more tender. She has
been the sunshine and joy of my old age. I can
scarcely bear to think for a moment that she should
leave me, but it is a matter of a short time only. The
old ship and I are ready to go, and yet I would fain
see her provided for before."
</p>

<p>
"Admiral Stewart," said Mrs. Revere, gravely,
"you touch me profoundly. I divined that things
might be as you say when I saw your granddaughter.
The marriage of a son is always a grief to a mother,"
she continued, somewhat sadly. "She feels that, in a
certain sense, she will be supplanted in her boy's
heart, and I have long accustomed myself to think of
another wife for Richard; but of her own will she
has given him his freedom. I thought it would be a
grief to my son, but I find that it is a joy. Is it
not so, Richard?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mother, the greatest joy, almost, that ever
came to me, except loving Emily."
</p>

<p>
"Very well. Admiral Stewart, I never had a little
girl. God has given me but this, my son. I will receive
Emily gladly. She shall be to me a daughter,
indeed, and I will endeavor to be to her a mother."
</p>

<p>
"Emily! Josephine!" called Richard, instantly,
stepping into the hall. "Come here!"
</p>

<p>
The deep satisfaction in his heart spoke in the
tones of his voice. Emily and Josephine comprehended
it well. As the two girls came on the porch,
Mrs. Revere again took the younger in her arms.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child," she said, with kindly affection,
"I learn that you are going to be my daughter. I
am very glad. In fact," she added, drawing back her
head and looking at the girl approvingly, "the more
I see of you, I believe the more pleased I shall be."
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you, Richard," said Josephine,
"and I do it honestly, too. Emily and I are destined
to be great friends, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Revere," said Emily, her eyes filled
with tears, she could not tell exactly why, "you have
made me so happy! I know I have many things to
learn, but with you to teach me and Mr. Revere to
help me&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"And me, too," interrupted Josephine; "don't
forget me!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and you, I am sure I shall learn, and I shall
try very hard to be what you want me to be and what
I ought to be."
</p>

<p>
"Be your own sweet self, dear," said the older lady,
patting her approvingly, "and you will do."
</p>

<p>
"Emily, bring me the sword of the <i>Constitution</i>,"
said the admiral. "Richard, lad, I give it to you,"
he added, as it was handed to him by the girl. "May
you wear it always in defence of our beloved country,
holding it ever at her service, defending the honor of
her flag. After Emily it is my chiefest treasure,
young sir. It has gone with me on many a cruise. I
have worn it, not without some honor, too, in battles
and on dangerous service. I give it gladly into your
hands, as I give you Emily. I know you will wear
the one honorably and treat the other lovingly. When
you look upon it, when your children gather about
your knee and marvel at its quaintness, mark the rudeness
of the hilt in contrast to its jewelled scabbard
and brilliant blade, tell them of me, who shall never
see them. Tell them the story of '<i>Old Ironsides</i>'
and the last of the fighting captains of the <i>Constitution</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Revere, as the old man solemnly pressed
his lips to the iron guard and extended the sword to
him, "I take it as a knight of old received the accolade;
and, as the men of the past did, I swear upon
the hilt of the sword that I will be everything a man
ought to be to a woman, to your granddaughter,&#8212;and
more."
</p>

<p>
At this moment Revere's man rode up to the porch,
dismounted, touched his hat, and held out a letter,
reporting,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"I did not find them, sir."
</p>

<p>
"They are here, Baker. I'll take the letter. Say
nothing about it to any one, and then go back to the
inn and arrange to bring the trunks of the two ladies
over here."
</p>

<p>
Revere had descended to the foot of the steps to
meet the man, and he had spoken softly when referring
to the letter, so that all the party on the porch
heard of the colloquy was the direction about the
baggage. Nor had any of them, except Emily, seen
the man hand him the letter. With it in his hand,
Revere walked up the steps and handed it to his betrothed
without a word. A glance told her that it
was addressed to Josephine Remington, and Emily
understood instantly that it was the famous letter about
which they had quarrelled.
</p>

<p>
What should she do was in her mind; what would
she do in his. Her temptation was strong. It would
have been a triumph to have handed the letter over
to Josephine at once. She hesitated for a few seconds,
and, choosing the greater triumph, thrust it quietly
into the bosom of her dress. She had decided not
to give it to Josephine, after all, so Revere read her
smiling gesture, and in the same mute, eloquent way
he thanked her for her forbearance.
</p>

<p>
"Who is this coming up the path?" said Josephine,
tactfully, breaking the pause which threatened to become
an awkward one, and pointing to the brow of
the hill.
</p>

<p>
"It is Captain Barry," answered Emily, glad of the
interruption.
</p>

<p>
"The old sailor of whom I spoke to you, madam,"
said the admiral, turning to Mrs. Revere.
</p>

<p>
"The man who rowed the boat the night Emily
pulled me out of the water, mother," Revere explained.
</p>

<p>
"My man," said Mrs. Revere, graciously, as Barry
stopped at the foot of the steps and saluted, "I have
to thank you for a great deal, I understand. It was
your strength and determination, coupled with this
young lady's skill, that saved the life of my son. I
owe you much, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You owe me nothing, ma'am," said Barry, ungraciously.
"I only obeyed Miss Emily's orders.
What she says, I do. I always do."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, you did it," continued Mrs. Revere,
struck by his harsh words and repellent manner, but
trying to suppress her astonishment and be kind to
this strange old man, "and I feel deeply grateful. Is
there any way in which I can show it?"
</p>

<p>
"No way, ma'am," burst out the sailor, almost
rudely.
</p>

<p>
He hated the whole brood,&#8212;mother, son, friend, all
of them, it seemed.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with you, Captain Barry?"
gently asked Emily, who had been scrutinizing the
man's pale, haggard face, his bloodshot eyes, his
utterly despairing, broken, yet firmly resolute look.
She, too, had been surprised and deeply pained by
his words and actions.
</p>

<p>
"Nothin', Miss Emily," he answered, turning toward
her, his face working with emotion he vainly strove to
control; "nothin'. I&#8212;Miss Emily&#8212;the ship&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"What of the ship?" cried the admiral, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"It's almost gone, your honor. I came to ask the
leftenant to go down with me an' take another look
at it."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Barry," cried Richard, springing to his
feet, eager to do anything for the old man, and anxious
to terminate a scene painful to all of them,
although he could not tell why. "I shall be back in
a few moments, Emily, mother. Good-by. Come
along, man," he said, striding lightly down the path.
</p>

<p>
But Barry lingered in apparent reluctance at the
foot of the steps. He seemed wistful to say something,
but words failed him. He turned to go,
stopped, faced about again.
</p>

<p>
"The ship," he said, hoarsely; "I'm afraid it's gone.
Good-by, your honor. Good-by, Miss Emily," he
added, hoarsely, and then he turned again with a gesture
and a movement which gave to all who were so
intently watching him the impression that he was
somehow breaking away from his moorings, and
walked rapidly down the hill.
</p>

<p>
"The ship! the ship!" murmured the admiral, oblivious
of all the rest, leaning forward in his chair over
the rail of the porch and gazing at the vessel.
</p>

<p>
His hand grasped the hilt of the sword of the
<i>Constitution</i>, which Richard had handed back to him
as he left. Emily stepped over to his side and stood
there with her arm around his neck. They waited in
silence a little, a foreboding of disaster stealing over
them.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," she said, presently, in tones of great
anxiety, "what the matter can be? I am afraid it is
something serious. I never knew Captain Barry so
agitated."
</p>

<p>
"It's the end, daughter, the end. I feel it here,"
murmured the old man, staring before him.
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather, if you don't mind, I think I will go
down to the ship," said Emily; "I'm so anxious."
</p>

<p>
"Don't go too near it, child," said the old man;
"one life is enough for the ship."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go with you?" asked Josephine, noticing
how pale and worried Emily looked, and feeling
somewhat alarmed herself.
</p>

<p>
"Go, both of you, and I will stay with the admiral.
Look to Richard," said Mrs. Revere, apprehensively,
sure now that something was seriously wrong.
</p>

<p>
Poor Emily was in two minds about the matter.
She wished to remain with the old man, and yet,
when she thought of Revere on that ship with Captain
Barry, and how strangely, how madly, almost
insanely, the sailor had looked, her heart smote her
with undefined terror of she knew not what.
</p>

<p>
She must go! It might be too late already!
</p>

<p>
The two girls ran swiftly toward the ship in vague
but rapidly increasing fear.
</p>

<p class="chapter">
CHAPTER XXII
</p>

<p class="head">
"<span class="sc">Samson Agonistes</span>"
</p>


<p>
As Revere and Barry walked down the hill
the soul of the younger man was filled
with light-hearted joy. He talked
gayly to the old sailor, who had
speedily joined him; and although the
monologue&#8212;since Barry had said nothing&#8212;could not
have been called a conversation, Richard did not
heed his silence.
</p>

<p>
It was but a short distance from the house to
the ship, but in the brief time required for the
passage Barry lived over his life, or that part of
it at least which was of moment. As life is compassed
in instants to the drowning, so in these seconds
through his mental vision swept the past. He saw
again the admiral as he had seen him in the prime of
manhood; he recalled once more the blue-eyed,
sunny little baby he had held so tenderly in his unfamiliar
arms; who, in the society of the two men,
had grown to be a woman whom he loved. The
days and years of happy companionship, of humble
and faithful service on the one hand, of kind and
generous recognition on the other, passed before him
with incredible swiftness.
</p>

<p>
The thought moved him to a sudden tenderness.
As his eyes fell upon the gay, debonair figure walking
so carelessly by his side, he hesitated. For a moment
his determination wavered. Revere did not look or
act like a scoundrel, perhaps; but with equal swiftness
came the terrible evidence of those papers, those
damning papers in the locker! The ship, the maiden!
The one was to be sold, the other betrayed. Under
God, that should never be! And he had kissed her.
He was bound to another. And she loved him and
had wept before him. This trifler was breaking her
heart.
</p>

<p>
Every laugh that rang in his ears in his changed
mood added intensity to his malign purpose. He was
no murderer, though. He believed himself a chosen
instrument in God's hand to effect a mighty purpose,&#8212;salvation
to those he loved.
</p>

<p>
Alas! humanity is never so hopelessly blind as when
it does wrong, believing that God sanctions it for
some longed-for end.
</p>

<p>
The two men stopped as they reached the ship.
</p>

<p>
"It's just here, sir," said the old sailor, hoarsely.
"I've been examinin' her all mornin'. The supports
is rottin' away. I think a touch'll send her down.
Would you mind goin' in there an' takin' a look?"
</p>

<p>
He pointed toward a place on the keel enclosed
between two rows of weather-worn timbers, which
supported, or helped to support, the body of the ship.
It was the place where, the night before, he and
Emily had pledged their hearts to each other and
solemnly plighted their troth. Revere recognized
the spot, of course, with a thrill of recollection; but
of course he made no mention of the fact. Barry
knew it, however, and for that reason he had chosen
it. The choice was part of his revenge. Where
Revere had loved&#8212;or trifled&#8212;there he should die!
</p>

<p>
"Looks bad, doesn't it?" Revere said, walking
into the <i>cul-de-sac</i> so carefully prepared for him, and
stooping down and laying his finger on the mouldering
keel.
</p>

<p>
Barry promptly followed him and stood between the
outermost stanchions, barring the exit. The unconscious
Revere was completely enclosed. The keel on
the rotting ways was in front of him, on either side the
close rows of supports, overhead the mighty floor of
the ship, back of him the huge form of Captain
Barry. He suspected nothing, however,&#8212;how should
he?&#8212;until he turned to go back after his brief examination,
when he was greatly surprised to find the way
blocked.
</p>

<p>
His situation beneath the ship was such that he
could not even stand upright, but was forced to remain
in a crouching position of great disadvantage
before the sailor. The old man stood with his arms
extended from stanchion to stanchion, a perfect tower
of strength and determination. It was useless for
Revere, even if he had realized at that moment what
was about to happen, to attempt to move him by
force. In his weakened state he could do nothing.
Even at his best he was no match for the huge old
giant barring his way.
</p>

<p>
The old man's face was engorged with blood, his
jaw was set rigidly, and a little fleck of foam hung
upon his nether lip. There was such a glare of demoniac
rage in his eyes, such an expression of mortal
bitterness and malevolent antipathy in his grim and
forbidding countenance, that the heart of the young
man, though he was as brave a sailor as ever trod a
deck, sank within him. He was fairly appalled by
this display of sinister and unsuspected passion.
</p>

<p>
"My God, man!" cried Revere. "What's the
matter? Stand aside!"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, you can't pass me. I'll never stand
aside. Say a prayer, for, as there's a ship above you
an' a God that favors no traitors, your hour is come."
</p>

<p>
His usually rough voice, harsher than ever on account
of his emotion, was shaking with passion.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean to kill you where you stand, where you
kissed her last night, you traitor, you dog, you that
disgraces your uniform, you that sells my ship, mine!
You that robs the old admiral of life, that betrays
Miss Emily, that breaks her heart! You thought to
play with that child. But I know you! I found
your orders. I read 'em, curse you! To sell the
ship,&#8212;God! my ship, that I've lived on, that I've
loved, for twenty-five years! I read your letters
writ by that woman you're goin' to marry! I saw
you kiss Miss Emily, I saw her go from you cryin'!
Tears for you, damn you! You've got to die, an'
I'll die with you! You'll have the company of a
better man to hell, where you belong!"
</p>

<p>
The old man's voice rose almost to a scream as he
recounted the ideas which had goaded him to this
madness. The torrential sentences of the grim indictment
fairly burst from his lips with ever-increasing
force and fury. Revere heard him in a daze of
surprise, at first scarcely comprehending the man's
meaning; yet, after all, his words explained many
things. As soon as the lieutenant found voice he
protested.
</p>

<p>
"Barry, I swear to you&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence! It's too late to swear!"
</p>

<p>
Revere was brave; he fain would not die without a
struggle for his life. Indeed, he had not divined the
manner of his death; but before he could spring forward,
Barry, as if he understood what he was about
to do, said, ruthlessly,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Stand where you are! If you move, I'll kick
you to death like a dog!"
</p>

<p>
He could easily have done it, as the advantage of
position was with him. Rather anything than that,
thought Revere, shuddering at the brutality of it.
A prisoner, he could do nothing. The man was
mad. If he chose to carry out his purpose, whatever
it might be, the young man was helpless.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Barry," he said, instantly accepting
the situation, and summoning all his resolution to
meet the inevitable, though his cheeks and lips were
white, "you saved my life once, you may take it
back now. I wish I could die standing, but if I
cannot, why kneeling is as good a way as any for
a man to meet his Maker. You tell me to say a
prayer. Here it is. May God have mercy on your
soul and on my soul, and may He keep the child.
That's all."
</p>

<p>
Not moving from his position, the old man began
kicking at the stanchions. The one on the right was
defective, and gave way and fell at the first blow. A
shiver seemed to run through the ship; Richard, for
the first time, divined what was about to happen.
He looked forward and aft. The effective supports
were all gone; some rotten ones remained, outwardly
intact, but bound to go under almost any pressure;
the few sound ones left had been carefully sawed
almost through. Why had he not noticed it? The
whole ship, therefore, practically rested on a single
stout stanchion toward which Barry had already
turned. It was a splendid piece of timber, and Barry
had put it in himself a year before. When that came
down, the ship would crash into ruins and bury them
beneath it.
</p>

<p>
As the prop upon the right had fallen, the hope
leaped into his mind that he might get away through
the gap; but Barry reached down and grasped him
by the collar with one hand the instant the way was
open, and held him firmly while he turned his attention
to the other stanchion. It was hopeless for
Revere to attempt anything.
</p>

<p>
Strange as it may seem, there was a certain admiration
for the sailor in Revere's mind, even in that
frightful moment. He realized that the attack upon
him was not inspired by any petty cause. Given the
belief of the sailor, it was natural; he respected him
for his desire to stop what he believed to be base
treachery; and Revere could have loved him for his
willingness to sacrifice himself to prevent what he
conceived to be a crime against the life of the admiral,
the happiness of Emily, and the existence of the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Barry," said Revere, calmly,&#8212;he was quite master
of himself now,&#8212;as the old man struck the last
sound support a heavy blow with his foot, "I must
tell you, not because I am afraid to die, or because
I fear you, but to acquit myself of evil purpose in
your mind, that my engagement with that other
woman is broken; that not an hour ago, in my
mother's presence, the admiral promised to give me
his granddaughter to be my wife."
</p>

<p>
"The ship?" cried Barry, hoarsely, as he felt his
vengeance slipping away from him, the cause itself
being taken.
</p>

<p>
"I offered to buy it myself and leave it standing
until it fell."
</p>

<p>
Men do not often lie in the very presence of death,
and truth spoke in the younger man's voice,&#8212;truth
so clear that it pierced the tortured soul of the jealous,
mad, broken sailor. But, like many another man
convinced against his will, he refused to accept these
statements. It was a device, a cunning attempt to
stay his hand and gain a life. He would not heed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you, damn you!" he said, kicking
furiously at the stanchion.
</p>

<p>
The last blow loosened it. Under the tremendous
pressure from above, the stick began slowly, very
slowly, to slide on its wooden shoe. Its motion was
scarcely perceptible, yet it moved. Barry released
his hold on it, took a single backward step, and
Revere rose to his feet. Barry instantly grappled
him with both hands. Revere was as a child in that
iron grasp. He did not struggle. He would preserve
his dignity in the face of death, and to attempt to
escape would have been futile, anyway. The two
faces confronted one another, the sailor's convulsed
with anguish and rage, the officer's pale, but smiling
a little; both equally determined.
</p>

<p>
Forward and aft the rotten or sawed supports were
giving way in quick succession. Above them the
ship was trembling and shivering from stem to stern.
A strange creaking was heard. A moaning cry,
swelling into a deep groan of anguish that had a
sound of despair unspeakable in it. The death-song
of the ship! It was coming down on the ways!
Moving toward the water at last!
</p>

<p>
Fascinated, Revere turned his face upward and
watched the shivering frame above his head, murmuring,
as he did so, Emily's name. The huge bulk
seemed to rise in the air for a second. To his distorted
vision it appeared to sway back and forth, up
and down, yet it had scarcely begun to move.
</p>

<p>
Ah! was it upon them?
</p>

<p>
It all happened in a few seconds. In another it
would be over. Revere closed his eyes.
</p>

<p>
At that instant a scream fraught with terrible
agony broke upon the ears of the two men.
</p>

<p>
"The ship is falling!" cried Emily's voice, high-pitched,
shrill with mortal terror. "Richard! What
are you doing? Oh, God! Captain Barry, save him!"
</p>

<p>
"Would that she might have been spared this!"
flashed into Revere's mind. He would have called
to her had not something happened instantly.
</p>

<p>
The voice awakened the dormant reason in the
old man's being. She loved this boy; perhaps he
had told the truth.
</p>

<p>
"Save him! save him!"
</p>

<p>
The words rang in his ears. He had never disobeyed
a command of hers. He would not now.
Too late! There was a terrible grating sound; the
last stanchion was grinding in its wooden shoe; it was
sliding faster! In another moment the ship would
be upon them! He had turned his head as the first
cry had met his ear, and had seen in one swift glance
Emily and another woman not a hundred feet away.
Emily was bending forward, her hands outstretched,
struggling. She would have run to them under the
ship had not the other woman held her firmly,
protectingly. Both girls were white as death.
</p>

<p>
Barry seized Revere by the collar and threw him
violently far from him. The young man pitched
downward and fell headlong on the grass in the direction
of the two women. The ground sloped abruptly
away toward the water on that side of the ship. In
that same instant the sailor threw up two great arms
and caught the impending ship. He took the place
of the quivering, buckling, sliding oaken timber.
For a second he stood there in mighty majesty, a
pillar of strength and resolution, a tower of flesh and
blood, sustaining a ship-of-the-line, a human stanchion,
magnificent in the frenzied, awful expression of a
power superhuman. Rigid, unbreakable, indomitable,
he shored up the ship,&#8212;Atlas holding the world!
</p>

<p>
"Go!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
Revere, who had risen instantly, stepped toward
him as if to assist him.
</p>

<p>
"Go! Can't hold&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
It had come. Angry at the momentary check, the
ship fell upon the man as an avalanche falls upon
the mountain. Beneath it the mighty knees were
bowing, the stubborn back bending, the great arms
trembling.
</p>

<p>
Revere sprang backward and slipped far down the
slope.
</p>

<p>
As he fell he caught sight of burning eyes from a
face white as the sea-froth, of lips set and bloodless,
of jaws clinched, of sweat standing upon a bronzed
forehead&#8212;picture impressed upon his soul forever!
</p>

<p>
There was a mighty roaring, detonating crash and
all was over.
</p>

<p>
Crushed were the mighty arms, beaten down the
massive shoulders, broken the iron knees. The life
of the man went out in the fall, and the blood of his
heart rippled along the blocks of the keel. With a
concussion like the discharge of a battery, the mighty
war-monster collapsed into a shapeless mass of timber,
burying beneath it the man who had loved it
best. The ship that had been his own was nothing
but a heap of ruins above his still heart.
</p>

<p>
A cloud of dust rose and hung over the wreck in
the quiet air.
</p>

<p>
War was to have been the trade of that ship-of-the-line. Blood should have run upon her white
decks, death she should have dealt out and received,
great battles should have made her famous, heroic
men should have written her name eternally on the
red pages of her country's history. Now it was
finished; and yet, in the ending at least, there had
been a slight fulfilment of her destiny&#8212;to kill.
</p>

<p>
No struggle could have been more superb than the
quiet one just over; no effort more magnificent, no
conflict more terrible, than that between the man
and the ship. No ship had ever claimed a nobler
victim than Barry, after all, and no fate could have
been more fitting than that which had come to man
and ship together in the end.
</p>

<p>
The old war-vessel had lived through the still ages
of peace, had survived the long period of decay, had
endured the disintegrating assaults of time, only to
accomplish her manifest purpose of destruction as she
fell.
</p>

<p>
And the hand that had loved her was the hand
that had laid her low!
</p>

<p>
With dreadful feelings in their hearts, the three
stood looking at the ruins of the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Barry! Captain Barry!" screamed Emily, wildly.
"Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"There!" gasped Revere, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"And is there no hope?"
</p>

<p>
"None. He is gone forever. My God, wasn't it
terrible? He held up the ship!"
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather!" cried the girl, distraught. "Let
us run to him."
</p>

<p>
The old man still sat on the porch, staring at what
had been the object of his gaze for so many years.
There was a peaceful, yet sorrowful, look upon his
face. He had seen the ship fall; he realized that his
hour had come. He was fronting death and he
knew it, yet he was as calm as he had been when he
had fronted death many times years before. They
gathered about him, understanding, helpless.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," he said, "the cruise is over. Where's
Barry?"
</p>

<p>
"Under the ship, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And a good end! Strike the flag. I've lost my
last command."
</p>

<p>
Instantly Revere ran to the foot of the staff and
silently cast off the halliards. As the little blue flag
of a rear-admiral, with its white stars, came floating
gracefully, reluctantly, down from the masthead
where it had flown so long, the veteran slowly and
painfully rose to his feet. With his right hand he
lifted the sword of the <i>Constitution</i>, with his old
vigor and his old grace he bared the blade and
brought it up before him in graceful salute, while the
flag fell into Revere's arms.
</p>

<p>
"Come aboard, sir," he said, softly, as if to an
Eternal Captain.
</p>

<p>
He stood erect a moment and then sank gently
back into the chair. For the first time in his life he
forgot the weapon in his hand. The sword fell clattering
at his feet. The emblem of power, authority,
and rank, all now slipping from him, lay neglected
where it fell. A smile quivered upon his lips, but
otherwise he sat still and quiet, looking out into the
future. A few seconds. The light faded from his
eyes, the life left his heart. The ship had fallen, the
flag was down. It was the end.
</p>

<p>
The old man had entered the last haven, dropped
anchor in the final harbor. The little breeze which
lifted his white hairs so tenderly had wafted his soul
into another country, a better&#8212;that is, an heavenly!
</p>

<p>
With a low cry, Emily threw herself on her knees
before him.
</p>

<p>
Down on Ship House Point a light, a flame,
burst out amid the torn and shattered timbers. In a
few moments the ruins of the now unheeded ship were
blazing furiously. Barry had cunningly planned it
so that the ship, after it had buried him, should be
his funeral pyre.
</p>

<p>
Fitting it might have been, thought Revere in his
heart, as he looked at the flames roaring up from the
ship, if the body of the admiral, like that of the
Vikings of old, might have been laid upon its burning
timbers.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<a name="envoi">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="fm3">
<span class="sc">L'Envoi.</span>
</p>

<p>
When he was buried, his country, recognizing his
merit and remembering his services again, sent its
best to honor him in death. Admiral Farragut, with
a brilliant staff, was there. He was of the navy of
the present, Revere represented the navy of the
future, and both stood together at the grave of the
navy of the past.
</p>

<p>
They buried him on the high hill overlooking Ship
House Point. Down on the Point, at the admiral's
feet as it were, and just where the ship had stood,
Revere erected a huge block of rough granite which
bore this inscription:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ctr">
<span class="sc">John Barry</span>,<br>
Chief Boatswain's Mate of the<br>
United States Ship-of-the-Line <i>Susquehanna</i>,<br>
Who perished in the fall of that ship, September 20th, 1865.<br>
"<i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down<br>
his life for his friends.</i>"
</p></div>

<p>
In the lofty character of his motives, in the atonement
of his self-sacrifice, in the greatness of his end,
his purpose of destruction was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
When his naval duties permitted, Emily and
Richard often came back to the old white house on
the hill in the summer, and to Charles Stewart Revere,
John Barry Revere, little Emily Revere, and Richard
Revere, Junior, it was the most fascinating spot on
earth. They stand with their father by the huge
Celtic cross which marks the admiral's resting-place,
and hear again the story of the sword of the <i>Constitution</i>,
destined one day to be drawn against the
country in which it had been made. Or&#8212;and this
they like even better&#8212;they sit with their mother
(lovelier in Richard's eyes with every passing year)
beneath the shadow of the mighty rock on the Point,
while she tells them stories of old John Barry, and
how at the last he held up the ship.

<p>
The most popular theatre in America, according to the advertisements,
where nothing was played but the "continuous," was packed from parquet
to top gallery with a perspiring crowd of pleasure-seekers one hot
August night. The papers had said&#8212;<i>via</i> the society columns,
of course&#8212;that everybody was out of town for the summer, and
incidentally, therefore, that all the ordinary places of amusement were
closed, except <i>Les Vari&#233;t&#233;s</i>. However, the city was not
quite deserted; for, of the anchored ninety-nine hundredths of the
population, all who could do so, apparently in despair of other
amusement, and attracted by the popular prices, had crowded into "the
home of refined vaudeville," as it was called on the programme. The
house was fluttering with fans; most of the spectators and actors felt
as though they were slowly deliquescing in perspiration, but, on the
whole, the audience seemed to be enjoying it.
</p>

<p>
The usual <i>m&#233;lange</i>&#8212;how natural and appropriate
it seems to use French words when treating of the
vaudeville!&#8212;of entertainments entirely suited even to
a Mrs. Boffin, become a world-wide type of matronly
modesty and virtue&#8212;had been provided by the
high-minded and scrutinizing management. Ladies
in short skirts capered nimbly over the stage to the
"lascivious pleasing" of the banjo; gentlemen with
one leg rode marvellously endowed bicycles in impossible
ways; tumblers frisked and frolicked about without
the slightest regard either for temperature or gravitation;
happy tramps,&#8212;at least the announcements
said they were happy,&#8212;whose airy, carefully tattered
garments were in entire consonance with the heated
atmosphere, delivered themselves of speeches full of
rare old humor and fairly bristling with B&#339;otian
witticisms. There were men singers and women
singers, musical cranks, freak piano-players, monologue
artists, burlesquers, and then a little play,&#8212;at
least they said it was a play.
</p>

<p>
So with these multifarious stirrers-up-of-varied-emotions
the evening drew toward its close. Finally,
just before the biograph went through its eye-shattering,
soul-distressing performance, the little boy
who walked solemnly across the stage before each
turn with such a queer, self-important strut that the
regular patrons&#8212;those who came early and brought
their luncheon&#8212;felt disappointed when he took a
vacation, set out upon the racks, provided on either
side of the proscenium arch for the purpose, a tablet
bearing the name "Mademoiselle H&#233;l&#232;ne."
</p>

<p>
When the curtain rose thereafter the stage was set
for a woodland. The lights were turned thrillingly
low, so that the expectant audience were scarcely
aware how the tiny little body, whom they saw standing
in the full blaze of the calcium-light ray suddenly
flashed upon her from the mysterious apparatus in
the balcony, had reached the centre of the stage.
</p>

<p>
The little miss was apparently not more than six
years old. She had short white stockings on her
plump little pink legs, and her dainty feet were
covered with black ankle ties. She wore fluffy little
pink and white skirts like a ballet-dancer, and with
her little bare arms she blew graceful kisses to the
audience as she bounded before it. With her sweet
blue eyes, her golden hair, she made a beautiful
picture, as she pirouetted around the stage on the tips
of her ten little toes, kicking up her little legs, bending
her back, wriggling her skirts in imitation of
older and more sophisticated performers,&#8212;to put it
mildly,&#8212;which would have been more amusing if it
had not been a little pitiful.
</p>

<p>
So little, so cool, so sweet, so fresh, so innocent
she seemed, that in the hot theatre on that hot night
no wonder a great, rapturous "oh-h-h!" of delight
and approbation burst from feminine lips&#8212;and masculine
ones, too, if the truth be told. As the little
maid in perfect silence continued her dance, exclamations
of admiration rose from the audience, and
when she finished her first turn and stopped panting,
bowing, hand-kissing, the theatre rang with hand-clapping.
Though some of the fathers and mothers
in the audience, with thoughts of their own little folk,
murmured under breaths, "What a pity! She ought
to be at home in bed!" the witchery of her movements
and the charm of her face were as strong upon
them as they were upon the others; more so&#8212;they
had children of their own.
</p>

<p>
As she stopped and stood alone on the large stage
after her final <i>pas</i>, bowing again and again and
throwing more kisses in that sweetly infantile way,
there was a commotion among the people enjoying
"standing room only" in the passage-way at the
back of the parquet. A tall, broad-shouldered man
forced himself through the crowd, in spite of angry
remonstrances and rude resistance, and ran down the
aisle. His pale face was working with emotion, his
eyes shining.
</p>

<p>
"Nellie!" he cried as he ran, in a voice that
vibrated above the applause in the theatre. "Don't
you know me? Nellie! Nellie!" he continued,
stretching out his arms toward the little girl.
</p>

<p>
The noise of clapping hands died away as if by
magic, as they heard the cry, full of love and longing.
The man stopped in full view of the great audience.
The little girl, hearing the cry, with one hand still in
the air where the kisses had stopped half blown
away, looked at the man over the footlights, half-dazed,
apparently, by the situation.
</p>

<p>
"Papa! Papa!" she cried, suddenly awakening
to life and bounding toward him. "Papa, take me
home!" Every soul in the hushed theatre heard the
words in the sweet treble of childhood.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a  name="papa"><img src="images/005.jpg" alt="&quot;Papa! Papa!&quot; she cried, &quot;take me home!&quot;" width="329" height="500"></a></div>
<p class="caption">"Papa! Papa!" she cried, "take me home!"
</p>

<p>
"Where's your mother, baby?" asked the man,
apparently oblivious of everything but the little lass.
</p>

<p>
"She's dead, papa," answered the child, brushing
her little hand across her eyes. "I'm so glad you've
found me. Oh, take me away!"
</p>

<p>
"I will! I will!" said the man, desperately,
forcing his way toward the stage.
</p>

<p>
Two of the ushers and an officer had hurried down
the aisle and seized him by the arms. The piano-player
rose from his neglected instrument and caught
him also.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!" roared the man, shoving them aside
with superhuman strength, apparently. "She's my
daughter, I tell you! I will have her!"
</p>

<p>
The lights on the stage were suddenly turned up.
A hard-featured man came forward and grasped the
child by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"What's all this row?" he cried; "I'm the manager
of Mademoiselle H&#233;l&#232;ne. Her mother left the
child with me. She gets good food and clothes and
is well taken care of. What more does she want?"
</p>

<p>
"I want my papa! Oh, I want you!" cried the
little girl.
</p>

<p>
"And you shall have me, dear."
</p>

<p>
"No," said the man on the stage, roughly, "she
shall not!"
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," cried the other man, turning about
and facing the audience. "Friends, there is my little
daughter. Her mother ran away from me, left me.
I haven't seen Nellie for two years. I just happened
in here to-night and recognized her, and&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Give him his daughter," broke out a burly man
in the third row of the parquet, rising in his seat as
he spoke and shaking his fist at the man on the stage,
"or&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
The house was in a perfect uproar now. The
women in tears, the men screaming with flushed, excited
faces.
</p>

<p>
"Let him have her!"
</p>

<p>
"Give her up!"
</p>

<p>
"Let the child go with her father!"
</p>

<p>
"Shame! Shame!"
</p>

<p>
"Mob him!"
</p>

<p>
"Lynch the wretch!"
</p>

<p>
The man on the stage fairly quailed before this
outburst of popular passion; the ushers and officer
had released the other man, but before he could take
a step the local manager appeared on the stage in
the midst of the confusion. Lifting his hand to the
crowd, he finally succeeded in stilling the tumult.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard it all!" he cried, as soon as he
could command attention. "This theatre don't want
to part father and daughter. Give the child to the
man. And get out of here!" he added, turning
fiercely and shaking his fist at the hard-featured man
on the stage.
</p>

<p>
The latter let go the child's arm and shrank back
in the wings, followed by the jeers of the crowd.
Then the local manager took the little girl in his
arms, stepped over the footlights, and handed her to
the man who had claimed her.
</p>

<p>
He lifted her up, kissed her, and pressed her
tenderly to his breast. She clasped her little arms
around his neck and dropped her head on his shoulder
with a low cry of content.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir!" said the man to the manager;
"thank you all, ladies and gentlemen! Oh, I have
got her back again!"
</p>

<p>
He turned with his precious burden and walked
rapidly down the aisle, passed out of the door, and
disappeared in the night.
</p>

<p>
The house rang with cheers. Men and women stood
up and clapped and applauded and yelled like mad.
When a semblance of order was restored, the local
manager dismissed the audience. As he said, none
of the performers were in condition to go on further
after the little tragedy they had witnessed, which had
ended so happily, after all. Nor was the audience in
a mood for any more vaudeville after the bit of real
life in which they had participated.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
"How did it go off, Bill?" asked the brown-haired
man of the local manager in the office half an hour
later.
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" said the manager. "It was the greatest
act I ever saw. You did splendidly, old man. I
congratulate you."
</p>

<p>
"It has only one disadvantage," remarked the
hard-featured man: "you can only do it once in each
town. It's only good for one-night stands."
</p>

<p>
"And didn't Nellie do it well?" returned the
other.
</p>

<p>
"She did that," replied the local manager; "she
couldn't have done it better! It almost made me
weep myself."
</p>

<p>
"That child's a born actress," said the hard-featured
man; "she'll be a treasure some day, sure."
</p>

<p>
"She's a treasure now," replied the local manager.
"What a pity we couldn't do it over to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, men," said the brown-haired man,
"I feel real guilty somehow. Seems like such a
fraud&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Bill!" interrupted the manager, yet
with a note of sympathy in his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Rot!" commented hard features, not the least
comprehending.
</p>

<p>
"Where is she now?" asked the other, shaking his
head dubiously, still uncertain and unconvinced.
</p>

<p>
"Her father and mother took her home right after
the performance, and I hope she is fast asleep in her
bed by this time, like a good little girl," continued
the manager. "Here's your check, Bill. Be on
hand Monday night when we open at X&#8212;&#8212;"

The crime had been one of peculiar atrociousness. While the little old
man who kept the quaint curiosity-shop down on Linden Street seemed to
have few or no friends, he was blessed with a great many acquaintances,
especially among the people of the better class, for whom it was quite
a fad to visit the dingy, shabby little store, with its assortment of
bric-a-brac, mouldy books, articles of virtu, and antiques, genuine or
spurious, valuable or worthless, all heaped about in promiscuous

Indeed, the "Major" was not the least curious
object in the collection. Few people knew that the
title represented gallant and youthful soldiering in
Rebellion days before he shrivelled and dried up in
the musty little shop. When, therefore, he was
found dead among his raffle of goods, about half
after seven on a summer evening, with his brains
brutally beaten out by a hammer, which lay by his
side, the greatest excitement was manifested everywhere.
That a man should be murdered in a store
on one of the main thoroughfares of the city at that
hour and in that way; that the murderer should
make his escape by the front door, which was left
open, were in themselves sufficiently remarkable facts
to engage widespread attention.
</p>

<p>
Rewards were offered by the city government; the
metropolitan police force, supplemented by the best
detectives that could be imported, who were paid by
private subscription, worked upon the case in vain.
No clew presented itself, nothing whatever was discovered.
The contents of the shop were finally sold
at auction and the store was closed. The estate,
which was surprisingly small, contrary to the general
opinion,&#8212;which, in fact, consisted merely of the proceeds
of the sale of the goods,&#8212;was administered in
the interests of some distant connections, and the
whole affair after a short time was practically forgotten.
Yet somewhere on the earth a man wandered
with the guilt of murder heavy on his soul.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
When it was announced in the advertisements that
Sir Henry Irving, the great English actor, was to play
<i>The Bells</i> on Thursday night, society&#8212;and those not
within the charmed circle who could scrape together
the unusual price demanded by the elaborate nature
of Sir Henry's staging&#8212;anticipated a great intellectual
treat. To see the character of Matthias interpreted by such a master of the tragic art could hardly
be called entertaining, of course, yet anything which
takes us out of the humdrum routine of every-day
life and quickens the blood that beats with such
commonplace sluggishness ordinarily is most desirable.
It is easy, therefore, to understand the avidity
with which the opportunity for paying the unusual
price for being shocked and terrified was welcomed.
</p>

<p>
The play, with its damnable iteration of chiming
sleigh-bells and its awful portrayal of the struggles
of a crime-stained human soul against diabolic
memories, proceeded with that wonderful smoothness
and effectiveness for which Sir Henry's productions
were famous. After the short intermission at the
close of the second act, the audience, most of whom
were familiar with the story, settled themselves with
delicious thrills of foreboding anticipation to witness
the dreadful and harrowing d&#233;nouement in which the
murderer's dream&#8212;that the crime of years is at last
exposed and the brand of guilt is fixed upon his
honored brow&#8212;is exhibited on the stage in all its
terrific realism.
</p>

<p>
The house, including the stage, was totally dark.
A weird, ghastly beam of light thrown from the
wings fell fitfully upon the face of Sir Henry,&#8212;no,
of Matthias himself. The great actor's identity was
lost, merged, forgotten in the character he portrayed.
Not another thing could be perceived in the theatre.
The gaze of every man and woman and child in that
vast assemblage was concentrated upon that beautiful,
mobile, terrible face. The silence with which the
audience listened to that piercing, shuddering voice
out of the darkness was oppressive. Could one's
attention have been distracted from that stage he
might have caught the quickening intake of deep
breaths, or here and there marked the low, quivering
sighs with which nervous people, under the influence
of that terrible portrayal of the agony of remorse
and apprehension at detected murder, trembled,
watched, and waited.
</p>

<p>
Yet there was nothing actually to be seen in the
opera-house but the face of the actor, or sometimes
a white, ghastly hand and a dim, dark suggestion of a
body writhing in mortal torture, so keen as almost to
pass belief, in a <i>tour de force</i> of unwilling confession.
The detachment was perfect, the illusion was complete;
there before them was a soul in judgment.
</p>

<p>
As the man was forced, under the influence of a
higher power than his own, to describe the murder,
the base violation of hospitality, the blow of the axe
that killed a guest, by which fifteen years before he
had laid the foundation of his fortune; as he was
constrained to act again before his judges in hypnotic
trance the awful happenings of the tragedy of that
Christmas Eve, of which none had suspected him;
and when, on being released from the spell, his confession
was read to him by the court, and the realization
came to him that the fabric of respectability
which he had carefully created upon the shifting sand
of murder had crashed into nothing,&#8212;who, that has
seen it, or heard it, will ever forget the fearful anguish
and despair of that wrecked soul?
</p>

<p>
As Matthias fell prostrate at the feet of the judges,
moaning in utter desolation and abandonment, the
appalling stillness was suddenly broken, and this time
the sound came not from the stage. Out of the
darkness of the auditorium a thin, high voice, fraught
with a note of torture more real and intense, if possible,
than that which the marvellous skill of the actor
had produced, was hurled into the great vault of the
theatre.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," it cried; "you are wrong. It was a
hammer!"
</p>

<p>
The surprise of the audience for the moment held
them still, while the voice shrieked out in the darkness,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"It is enough! I'll confess. Guilty, oh, my
God, guilty! It was I! The murder&#8212;light, for
God's sake, light!"
</p>

<p>
A woman screamed suddenly. People rose to
their feet. One of those strange, swaying movements
which bespeak a panic ran through the
crowd. Matthias on the stage rose instantly,
faced about, and walked toward the dark footlights,
a genuine horror in his soul this time, for no human
voice that he had ever heard had carried such mortal
pain as that which had just spoken. The theatre
was filled with a babel of voices. Confused shouts
and cries came from all sides.
</p>

<p>
"Lights, lights!"
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Go on with the performance!"
</p>

<p>
At that instant the lights were turned up. There,
in the middle aisle, a few rows from the orchestra
rail, a tall, thin man, his haggard face white with
emotion, his eyes staring, his teeth clinched 'neath
bloodless lips, stood swaying unsteadily to and fro.
His hands uplifted as if to ward off a blow, he stood
utterly oblivious of everything but Matthias. From
the chair beside him a woman with a face scarcely
less white, in which were mingled incredulity, surprise,
and horror, reached her arms up to him as if to save
him.
</p>

<p>
"I can't stand it any longer!" cried the man,
staring up at Matthias. "You've done it. I'll confess
all! It has torn me to pieces!" he screamed,
clutching at his throat. "The Major&#8212;I beat him to
death with his hammer, like you did, for his money.
I took it from his person. I knew it was there. I
was his friend, his only friend. My God! There
was no place to burn his body. He's always at my
feet. He's staring at me now by you on the stage!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Henry shrank away involuntarily as the man
went on.
</p>

<p>
"Pity, pity!" he wailed, staggering, stumbling
forward, falling upon his knees nearer to Sir Henry.
"Mercy!" he whispered at last, yet with such distinctness
that they heard him in every corner of the
theatre.
</p>

<p>
He knelt with his hands outstretched toward the
stage, waiting for reprieve, sentence, condemnation,&#8212;God
knows what.
</p>

<p>
The audience stared likewise with suspended
hearts from the great but mimic figure of murder
on one side of the footlights to the greater and
real figure of murder upon the other. As they
gazed the man wavered forward again, sank lower,
his hands fell, but before he collapsed completely,
an officer of the law, the first to recover his wits
in the presence of the catastrophe, ran down the aisle
and pounced upon him. Grasping his shoulder, he
cried,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"You're my prisoner. I arrest you!"
</p>

<p>
"Too late," whispered the man; "I'm&#8212;going&#8212;going&#8212;to
plead&#8212;in another&#8212;court."
</p>

<p>
He pitched forward and fell on his face&#8212;dead.
And a woman, dry-eyed with horror, old love surviving
honor, respect, righteousness, knelt by his side,
took his head in her arms, and strove to kiss away
from his brow the mark of Cain.
</p>

<p>
So the mystery of the Major's murder was solved
at last, and Sir Henry, as he thought it over in his
chamber that night, realized that he had received the
greatest tribute that mortal man could pay to his
acting. His art had been so perfect&#8212;he had appeared
the incarnation of terror, remorse, and retribution&#8212;that
to that struggling soul he had been as the voice
of conscience,&#8212;nay, as the very voice of God. For
the man had actually given way, broken down, and
confessed a secret crime under the mighty spell of
his acting, and, as the criminal in the play, had died
in the confession!

I.&#8212;THE FIRST FLIGHT
</p>

<p>
Most written stories end with a
wedding, actual or prospective; but
this story, like most stories in real
life, begins with one. The little old
stone church in Manhattan, Kansas,
was crowded to the doors one June afternoon. The
gray-haired President, the younger men and women
of the faculty, and a small sprinkling of the towns-people
were there; but the great mass of the congregation
was made up of the students of the State
Agricultural College, which was situated on a gentle
hill just outside the town. It was Graduation Day,
and the day on which Sue Belle Seville and Samuel
Maxwell had elected to get married.
</p>

<p>
Samuel was a Kansas boy, Sue Belle a Kentucky
girl. They were both orphans and both graduates
from the college that day in the same class: Samuel
from the agricultural and mechanical department,
Sue Belle from the housekeeping, culinary, domestic
sciences, and other of the many departments feminine.
Maxwell was a manly, energetic, capable
fellow, a good student, and a young man who, given
an equal chance, should make a fine farmer. On
that day he was the envy of all the young men of
marriageable age in the college.
</p>

<p>
His bride to be, while she seemed made for better
things than the ineffably monotonous drudgery of
an ordinary farmer's wife, was nevertheless skilled
enough, capable enough, resolute enough, to master
her lot and be happy in it whatever it might be. She
was a handsome girl, tall, straight, strong, black-haired,
blue-eyed, with the healthiest whiteness in her
face that one could imagine.
</p>

<p>
The brief wedding ceremony was soon over. Old
Dr. Fairman, the President, gave the bride away in
his usual courtly and distinguished manner, and as
the village organist played the wedding-march on the
sweet-toned old organ, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Maxwell
passed out of the church, followed by all of the
congregation. At the end of the long cinder foot-path
extending from the church-door under the
double row of trees to the street stood a brand-new
Studebaker wagon filled with household goods. Two
stout, well-conditioned horses were harnessed to it,
while two others, a good mare and a handsome young
horse, a three-year-old colt, were fastened to the tail-board
by long hitching-straps. The wagon had been
transformed by a canvas canopy over the bed into
what was popularly known as a "prairie schooner."
The new canvas was white as snow in the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
Maxwell handed his wife to the seat on the front,
pitched quarters to the negro boys who had been
holding the horses' heads, gathered up the reins, and,
amid a storm of cheers and a shower of rice&#8212;especially
appropriate to an agricultural college, by the
way&#8212;and other manifestations of joy and delight,
drove away on the wedding journey. The watchers
followed with their eyes the wagon lumbering slowly
down the main street until it crossed the bridge over
the Kansas River and disappeared among the hills to
the southward.
</p>

<p>
After settling the expenses of their college course
and paying for their outfit, the two young people
found themselves in possession of some two thousand
dollars between them; more than enough, they fancied,
backed as it was&#8212;or should I say led?&#8212;by
two stout hearts and by four strong young arms, to
wrest a livelihood&#8212;nay, a fortune, perhaps&#8212;from the
prairies of the West.
</p>

<p>
An old, old story, this. A pair of home-builders
going out into a new land to conquer or die; to
establish another outpost of civilization on the distant
frontier, or to fail. A man and a woman who
had taken their all in their hands to consecrate it by
their toil to the service of humanity, and to stake
their happiness on the success of their endeavor.
True builders of the nation, they! Pickets they
were, going ahead of the advance guard of the army
of civilization's marchers, which, untold ages ago,
started in some secluded nook in the far Orient, and,
impelled by an irresistible desire for conquest, in
successive waves of emigration, has at last compassed
the globe, rolled around the world. Leaders, these
two, of that mighty deluge of men and women for
whom the sun of hope is ever rising,&#8212;but rising in
the West.
</p>

<p>
Never was such a wedding journey. It was springtime
in the most bountiful and fertile year that had
come to the great State for a generation. The way
of the lovers, as they plodded ever southward and
westward, led them now past vast fields of yellowing
wheat already beginning to ripen for the thresher.
Sometimes they drove for miles through towering
walls of broad-bladed, cool, green corn; sometimes
the trail led them over the untilled, treeless prairies
covered with tall, nodding sunflowers in all their gorgeous
golden bloom,&#8212;blossoms which gave the State
a name; and not infrequently their way would take
them alongside a limpid river, in that happy season
bank full from the frequent rains, where the winding
road would be overhung by great trees.
</p>

<p>
They stopped at night at the different little towns
through which their way passed, and once in a while
they enjoyed the hearty welcome of a lone farm-house.
Sometimes they hired a negro boy to drive the
wagon from one stopping-place to another, while they
mounted the two led horses and galloped over the
prairie. Samuel rode well, but to see Sue Belle on
that spirited young steed of hers was to see the perfection
of dashing horsemanship. An instinctive judge
of horse-flesh, she had bought that three-year-old
herself. He was a chestnut sorrel with a white blaze
on his face, and white forefeet, as handsome and
spirited as his mistress. In honor of her native State,
she called him Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
As they progressed farther and farther southwestward
the land became more open, the farm-houses
were greater distances apart, cultivated fields less
frequent, the towns were fewer in number and diminishing
in size, the rivers grew smaller and smaller,
and trees almost vanished from the landscape. Finally,
away out in Cimarron County, where the railroad
stopped and civilization ended, they reached
their journey's end. Such a wedding-trip they had
enjoyed, such a honeymoon they had spent!
</p>

<p>
They bought a bit of flower-decked prairie, a
quarter section crossed in one corner by a little creek
flowing southward until it joined a larger steam flowing
into the Arkansas River. The chosen land mostly
lay on the south side of a slight elevation from which
they could survey the grass-mantled plains melting
into the unbroken horizon miles and miles away.
The country about was entirely uncultivated and had
been mainly given over to cattle-raising; it was a
dozen miles to the nearest house and fifteen to the
town of Apache, the county-seat.
</p>

<p>
How still was that vast expanse of gently undulating
land of which they were the centre! An ocean caught
in a quiet moment, and every smoothly rolling wave
petrified, motionless. How vast was the firmament
above them! To lie in the grass at night and stare
up into its blue unclouded distance filled with stars&#8212;shone
they ever so gloriously anywhere else on the
globe?&#8212;was to reduce one's self to a vanishing point
in the infinite universe of God. Lonely? Yes, to
ordinary people, perhaps, but not to these two home-builders.
They were young, they were together,
they were lovers, and they had to do prosaic, God-given
labor.
</p>

<p>
So they pitched their stakes upon the verdant hill,
and, toiling early and late, built there for themselves
and those to come a home. With iron share they
tore the virgin sod; with generous hands they sowed
the seed; with all the hope of youth and love bourgeoning
and blossoming in their breasts, they began
the earth-old process of wresting a living from the
tillage of the soil. "In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat bread." So ran the primal truth. Ah, yes,
but this time counted not a curse but a privilege, and
enjoyed not without but within an Eden.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
II.&#8212;THE SECOND FLIGHT
</p>

<p>
Spring-time again upon the farm, and they were
bidding it good-by. Five years have dragged away,
years filled with little but misfortune&#8212;years of freezing
winters, burning summers, drought, or storm.
Five lean years of failure, unprecedented but true.
A long, deadly, paralyzing struggle with that terrible
minatory face of nature which, thank God! is usually
turned away from humanity, else we could not bear
the sight. The sun had beaten upon the farm and
burnt it up, the parasites had swarmed over the field
and eaten it down, the winter cold had frozen the life
out of it, the fierce storms had swept over it and torn
it away,&#8212;winter and summer had been alike against
them.
</p>

<p>
Last fall the deadly mortgage had grown from the
little hand-breadth cloud until it had covered the
land, blanketed it, blighted it, filled earth and sky to
them. It was over. They had toiled for naught, and
no profit had they taken of all their labor under the
sun. They were beaten at last.
</p>

<p>
Once more the old Studebaker wagon. Within it
a haggard, dogged, disappointed man,&#8212;yet indomitable;
a woman still young, robbed forever of the
brightness of youth, yet striving to nourish a spark of
the old hope,&#8212;a mother, too. Two little children
clung to her, healthy, lusty, strong, happy; they had
neither known nor suffered. There was the same old
team between the "tugs," sobered, quieted, saddened
like their master, perhaps, and Kentucky. Kentucky
was leaner than he should be, not so well nourished
as they would like to have him, but his spirit
was unabated. He, at least, had not been beaten
down.
</p>

<p>
So they set forth again. "Once more into the
breach," brave pair. Life insistently craves bread.
Men must work; ay, and women too, though they
may weep as well. There were the little children,
oh, father and mother! treasure of health and teaching
must be laid up for them. The old cause must
be tried out yet again. Farewell to defeat, farewell
to failure, farewell to the old. Let us stir up hope
again, look forward into the future, deserve a triumph.
All had been lost but love; that had not failed, and
while God is it cannot. It is a mighty talisman with
which to attempt the morrow. So armed, they started
out again.
</p>

<p>
With one hundred dollars in his pocket, a small
lot of household necessaries, a stove, some blankets,
etc., and Kentucky, Samuel Maxwell and Sue Belle
and the two children started out in the wagon again
to have another wrestle with fortune. They determined
to go to the Kansas-Indian Territory border
and try to secure free land in Oklahoma Territory,
which was to be opened for settlement that summer.
</p>

<p>
They hated the prairie where they had lived now.
It was associated with their ruin, eloquent of their
future. That season bade fair to be as bountiful a
time as had been the year of their arrival, but they
could not stay. They had pulled up the stakes, and
nothing was left for them but to go on. Indeed, they
were wishful to do so, and had they known that, as
it happened, the five years of starvation, drought,
and failure were to be succeeded by twice as many
years of abounding plenty, they would not have
stayed. They loathed the spot. They could not
have remained anyway. Another man held the farm
and succeeded where they had failed, reaping where
they had sown.
</p>

<p>
It was late summer when they reached Solomon
City, from which they had elected to make the
run into the hitherto forbidden land. The place was
filled with all sorts and conditions of men and women
attracted by the possibility of getting a quarter section
or a town lot practically free in the Cherokee strip;
there were half a million of them on the border-line!
And there, too, were congregated the human vultures
that live to prey upon the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The distribution of the lots and sections was to be
made on the principle of first come first served. All
seekers for locations were to line up on the edge of
the strip on a given date at a certain hour, and when
a signal was given they were to rush into the Nation,
drive a stake in a quarter section, or in a town lot at
the places where the towns had previously been surveyed
and lots plotted and staked out by the government,
throughout the vast body of land in the Indian
Territory thrown open for settlement. Then they
were to hold their places, living in tents and shanties,
until they could erect houses and prove their claims.
</p>

<p>
Samuel intended to ride Kentucky into the strip
and take his chance at a town lot. He had had
enough of farms. Not many miles below Solomon
City, on the railroad running through the "strip,"&#8212;as
the land was called,&#8212;the future town of Newlands
had been laid out by the surveyors. It was a paper
town as yet, but the day after the run would see it
suddenly become a city, and good lots would probably
be of value. If he could get a good one it
might be worth several thousand dollars, and he could
start again. It was a desperate chance, but he had
to take it; there was nothing else.
</p>

<p>
Ill fortune was not yet done with them, however,
for in scrambling down the bank of the river to get
water for his team, the unfortunate man fell and broke
his arm. He climbed up to the wagon, sank down
on the dry grass beside it, and gave way. Sue Belle
stood by with white face as the local doctor bound up
his arm, but she did not cry. She felt that she had
other things to do, that she must play the man, and
that she could not indulge in the womanly luxury of
weeping.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not crying, doctor, because it hurts," said
Samuel, brushing away his tears with his uninjured
arm; "but because this seems to be just the last
straw in our bad luck. We were married five years
ago, and we bought a farm in Cimarron. I'm a good
farmer, I was born on a farm and raised on it, and I
was trained in the Agricultural College in Kansas. I
know the thing theoretically and practically, too, but
everything failed us. We've lost everything, and we
came here in the hope of getting something out of
the strip. God's forgot us, I guess."
</p>

<p>
The doctor had seen many cases like that in the
Southwest, and, though his heart was profoundly
touched, he could do nothing.
</p>

<p>
That night Samuel lay awake in the wagon almost
forgetting the pain in his arm wondering what would
become of them. He had lugged out his old leather
purse and counted the money that was left,&#8212;ten
dollars! That was all that stood between them and
starvation! The strip was to be opened to-morrow,
the run would take place then. What, in God's
name, could he do?
</p>

<p>
"Sam," said Sue Belle, lying awake by his side,
"don't give way so!"
</p>

<p>
"Give way, dear!" he groaned. "How can I help
it? Ten dollars between you and the children and
starvation! This town here can't help any one.
These people around us can't Look at them!
They're as poor as we are. Five years of crop
failure has hit them as hard as it has hit us. The
run takes place to-morrow, and I can't ride. I did
hope that I could get a town lot in Newlands. I
don't believe that anything here can outrun Kentucky;
but now&#8212;oh, my God! my God!"
</p>

<p>
"Sam dear, I'll ride Kentucky."
</p>

<p>
She spoke resolutely, having thought quickly, and
her mind was made up.
</p>

<p>
"We've got no side-saddle," answered the man;
"you know we sold it."
</p>

<p>
"I can ride astride," said the woman, having covered
this point also in her mind. "I used to ride
that way when I was a girl. I've done it hundreds
of times, and I can make better time that way now."
</p>

<p>
"But, dear, you're a woman, and&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I can wear your clothes, dear. I'm almost as
tall as you are. They'll be rather large, but&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sue Belle, I can't allow you to go in there
alone, in all that crowd, with&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I've got to do it, Sam! It's our last chance.
It's for the children, not ourselves. We could die.
We've done our best. But think of them!"
</p>

<p>
She rose from her bed and crept over to the back
of the wagon where the little boy and girl lay sprawling
side by side in the dreamless sleep of childhood.
She pushed from the baby brows the curly hair
matted with perspiration, and stooped and kissed
them. She felt so strong, so brave, so resolute, as if
the burden which she had hitherto shared with
Samuel, or from which he had tried to spare her,
had suddenly fallen upon her own shoulders, and in
some strange way that she had been given strength
to bear it.
</p>

<p>
Long time that night husband and wife talked over
the situation. In the face of her determination the
man could not do otherwise than give consent. In
the morning, making him as comfortable as she could,
she plodded up through the dust to the city and
bought from the wondering shopkeeper a pair of
high boots that fitted her, since it would be impossible
for her to use her husband's huge ones. At Sam's
insistent demand, she also hired for five dollars a
poor stranded negro, who looked honest and faithful,
to drive the wagon after her into the strip. That
exhausted their ready money.
</p>

<p>
It was half after eleven o'clock when she returned
to the wagon. The doctor had been there, and had
done what he could for her fevered husband, but his
arm still pained fearfully. He was up, however,&#8212;he
had to be,&#8212;and seated on the dusty grass in the
shadow of the canvas top. The children were playing
about him. Bidding the negro boy hitch up
the team, Sue Belle slipped under the wagon-cover
and dropped the curtain. When she came out her
tall form was encased in her husband's only remaining
suit of clothes. She wore a soft felt hat
with her hair tightly twisted under it. A loose shirt,
trousers, and the new boots completed her costume.
Womanlike, she had tied a blue silk handkerchief&#8212;last
treasure-trove from her trousseau&#8212;around her
neck. There was a painful flush upon her thin face
and her eyes were filled with tears.
</p>

<p>
Samuel groaned and shook his head, the negro
boy gazed with mouth wide open, his eyes rolling,
and little Sue Belle shrank away from her mother
garbed in this strange manner. Kentucky, who had
been given the last measure of oats they possessed,
did not recognize her until she spoke, and then he stared
at her in a wondering way as she saddled and bridled
him. A hatchet and a tent-peg tied securely to the
saddle completed her preparations. By her husband's
insistence she strapped a spur on her boot, although,
as she said, she had never put a spur to Kentucky in
her life.
</p>

<p>
"You may have to do it now, dear," said Maxwell,
and to please him she complied.
</p>

<p>
Nobody paid any attention whatever to her, although
the boundary was lined, as far as eye could
see and for miles beyond, with crowds of people
intending to make the run. On the very edge of
the strip the runners had assembled on horseback
or muleback, on bicycles, in buggies, sulkies, or in
road wagons, and there were many dressed in jerseys
and running shoes who intended to make the run on
foot. Back of them in long lines were grouped
wagons of all descriptions, mostly filled with women
and children. All sorts and conditions of men were
represented in the huge and motley throng.
</p>

<p>
It was a blazing hot day. The shifting horde
raised clouds of dust above the line, from which the
bare, treeless prairie stretched away southward for
miles. There was not a soul on it except United
States cavalrymen, who were spread out in a long
line, each man being placed at a regular interval
from his neighbor. To the front of the troopers, the
captain in command sat his horse, holding his watch
in his left hand to determine the correct time, while
in his right he carried a cocked revolver.
</p>

<p>
Twelve o'clock was the appointed hour. The
soldiers on either side held their loaded carbines
poised carefully and looked toward the captain, or, if
too far away to see him, toward the next in line who
could. The signal for the start was to be given
simultaneously over the whole extended strip, stretching
for many miles along the Kansas border, by
means of these troopers. No one was to move until
the signal was given. The soldiers had scoured the
country for days to evict the "sooners,"&#8212;those who
had gone in before the appointed time and attempted
to conceal themselves that they might secure the best
lots.
</p>

<p>
Sue Belle turned and kissed the babies. Then she
bent toward Samuel, but he rose painfully to his feet
and stood flushed and feverish while he pressed her
to his side with his sound arm.
</p>

<p>
"May God protect you, dear," he said, trembling
with pain and agitation.
</p>

<p>
"He will! He will!" exclaimed the woman, fervently,
strong in her endeavor. "Now be sure and
have the wagon follow right after me. And you
know the doctor said he'd get you taken in some
place in town as soon as the run began; there'll be
lots of room there then. I'm going to ride straight
down to Newlands and try for a town lot. They'll
find me there. They ought to be there by evening,
and I'll manage somehow till then."
</p>

<p>
"But how'll you live till I get there?"
</p>

<p>
"I can cook or wash for hire; there'll be lots to
do there, and I'll write to you at once. Don't worry
about me, dear. I'm half crazy to think of leaving
you ill and alone&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you had a revolver, Sue Belle," groaned
Samuel.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I had, too," answered the woman; "but
never mind, we are in God's hands."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sue Belle, I can't let you go!"
</p>

<p>
"You must! I must go now! See! They're
getting ready!"
</p>

<p>
She tore herself away from him and spoke to the
colored boy.
</p>

<p>
"Joe," she said, "for God's sake, don't fail us! I
leave you my two little children; if you guard them
safely and bring them to me faithfully, whatever good
fortune comes to us you shall share."
</p>

<p>
"'Deed I will, suh, ma'am, miss,&#8212;yes, suh," stammered
the colored boy. "I'll tek good caah on
'em, mista&#8212;lady," he added, in his confusion.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
III.&#8212;THE THIRD FLIGHT
</p>

<p>
Without another word the woman sprang on the
horse and forced herself as near the line as she could.
She had lost an opportunity of getting in the very
front rank, but she knew her horse and did not care
for that. It wanted perhaps a minute to twelve
o'clock, and a silence settled down over the rude
assemblage, although the excitement was at fever
heat. Pushing and jostling would gain no advantage
now. The gray old captain of cavalry sat his horse,
intently gazing at his watch. The seconds dragged
and the multitude waited breathlessly. Suddenly he
closed it with a snap, lifted his pistol in the air, and
before the smoke of the discharge blew away a quick
volley rang along the line.
</p>

<p>
With a sort of a roar that echoed up into the
heavens for miles the runners sprang forward. There
was one mighty simultaneous surge of men and animals,
and then the line began to break. In the
cloud of dust that arose instantly, Maxwell, forgetful
of his broken arm, strove vainly to follow with
his gaze Sue Belle's flying figure. The next moment
he noticed that the ground directly in front of him
was deserted. An idea flashed into his mind. Regardless
of his pain, he sprang to his feet, with his
uninjured arm tore a loose bed-slat from the wagon,
and, stepping across the line, thrust it into the finest
quarter section of the strip. Nobody had thought of
doing this. The land adjoined the town of Solomon
City, and could probably be sold without delay for a
good sum of money. It was his. They were saved!
</p>

<p>
Oh, why hadn't he thought of it before and prevented
his wife from making the run? But it was
too late; she was gone. Calling the negro, he had
him take from the wagon a few of the boards which
had been brought along for the purpose, and nail
them together in a tent shape to make him a shelter.
Laying a blanket and a quilt on the ground, and setting
a bucket of water therein, he crawled under it,
knowing that some one sent by the doctor would certainly
come to him during the day, and determined
to hold his claim if he died for it. Then he bade
Joe load the children in the wagon, take them into
the strip, tell his wife of his good fortune, and bid
her come back to him, if she could.
</p>

<p>
What of the woman riding on with a broken heart,
yet with a grim determination somehow to achieve
fortune for her sick husband and her children? She
kept Kentucky well in hand, and yet easily passed
buggies, sulkies, runners, men on bicycles, and began
to overtake the horsemen galloping southward over
the prairie. At first the dust almost choked her.
The man's saddle annoyed her, too; but as she got
into clear air, and began to get accustomed to the
strangeness of her position, she regained her self-control.
She shook the reins lightly over the horse, and
he lengthened his stride and quickened his speed,
making swift progress for a long time.
</p>

<p>
Finally there was no one in front of her. To the
right and left, as far as she could see, horsemen
were galloping on; back of her they trailed in an
ever-thinning mass. Most of them she was leaving
rapidly. Kentucky was of racing stock. He was
three-quarter-bred and game to the core. The sight
of the other horses running by his side inspired him.
He had been ridden in a wild dash across the prairie
many a time, but never before in competition with
other horses. He took to the race instinctively, and
galloped on as if he had been trained to it from the
beginning.
</p>

<p>
She had hard work to hold him, yet she knew she
had a long ride before her, and if she did not keep
him well in hand he would be blown before he went
half the distance; so she held him down to it, riding
warily, watching carefully for prairie-dog holes, for if
the horse should thrust his leg into one he would
break it, and that would be the end of him and her
ride as well.
</p>

<p>
So she galloped on and on, still in the front line,
and with every surging leap leaving some beaten
runner behind. Now she drew ahead, now she led
the whole vast throng, and now the horse was out of
hand. He was running magnificently, but he had
gotten away from her, not viciously, but in pure joy
at being free in this mad race over the prairie. Presently
she looked back. The nearest rider seemed to
be half a mile behind her. It was not necessary for
her to get so far ahead, and she tried again and
again to check the horse, but without success.
</p>

<p>
Kentucky was running his own race now. How
he swept through the air! It was magnificent! The
exhilaration of the motion got into her blood. It
was long since she had had such a ride. She, too,
came of racing stock, and the habit of her sires reasserted
itself in her being. For a moment she forgot
Samuel, forgot the children. She forgot everything
but that wide open prairie, the wind blowing across
her face, the rapid rise and fall of the horse as
he raced madly on. Youth came back to her and
the joy of life; failure lay behind, success before.
Her heart beat faster in her breast. Kentucky gallantly
carried her forward. How long had she been
riding? She could not tell. They were not at Newlands
yet, she was certain, so she raced away. After
a long time she looked back and was astonished to
see two riders nearer to her than any had been
when she had looked before; all the rest were miles
behind.
</p>

<p>
The men were mounted on broncos,&#8212;the horse
<i>par excellence</i> of the West,&#8212;wild, vagrant descendants
of old Spanish breeds; animals without blood,
without birth, without beauty, without style, without
training, mean and vicious in disposition; utterly useless
for a short dash, and in an ordinary race unable
to approach a thoroughbred; but with a brutal, indomitable
spirit, a capacity for unlimited endurance
and tireless ability to run long distances and live on
nothing, and do it day after day, which made them
formidable and dangerous competitors for all other
horses of whatsoever quality. They were loping
along after her with an ugly yet very rapid gait,
which they could keep up all day if necessary.
</p>

<p>
Sue Belle thought Kentucky's stride was not quite
so sweeping as it had been; he seemed to be a little
tired; still, he was doing his best manfully. Although
he yet held the lead, he was not built for this kind
of a run. She realized it, but there was nothing she
could do to husband his strength, nothing left her
but to gallop on. And yet there was lots of go in
him yet. He was by no means done.
</p>

<p>
The prairie rolled away back of them as it was
compassed by the flying feet, and still the mighty
ride went on. The first bronco was nearer now.
He was not quite a mile away, but the second was a
longer distance behind the first and falling back.
The rest were nowhere. Of all the throng only
these three were in sight. Kentucky was very tired.
Surely they must be near Newlands now! The other
horse was coming up fast. She shook out the reins
and called to her own. The pursuer was nearer! He
was so near that at last Kentucky realized that he
was being pursued. They were almost there! In
front of them on the horizon she saw the land-office,
the station, and the hundreds of white stakes marking
the lots of the town.
</p>

<p>
The other horse was almost beside her now. Well,
suppose he did win the race? There were hundreds
of lots there, and the second choice would probably
be as good as the first. Should she let him pass?
No! That was not the Kentucky way. Should the
horse do it? No, again. She leaned forward over
the saddle and spoke to him; she drove the spur into
him at last. The surprised horse bounded into the
air with a sudden access of vigor, and he fairly leaped
away from the bronco. It was his final effort; when
this spurt was ended he would be done for. Would
it be enough?
</p>

<p class="caption">The surprised horse bounded into the air with a sudden
access of vigor
</p>

<p>
In her excitement she turned and shouted back to
the man, she knew not what, waving her hat in disdain.
Presently she turned into what appeared to be
the main street. Instinctively as they ran along she
chose what seemed to be the best lot in the prospective
city, and then reined in her panting, exhausted
horse; she sprang to the ground, tore the peg and
hatchet from the saddle-bow, and drove the stake in
the lot. Not a moment too soon, with not a second
to spare, she had won the race! The wild bronco
came thundering upon her heels. The man jerked
his horse to his haunches by the side of the triumphant
thoroughbred, dropped a rein to the ground to
keep him, sprang from the saddle, and stepped toward
her.
</p>

<p>
"I want that there lot!" he said, roughly. "It's
the best lot in the place. You kin take somethin'
else."
</p>

<p>
Sue Belle rose to her feet. Her hat had fallen off
in the wild ride and her black hair floated over her
shoulders. Excitement had put a light in her eyes,
color in her cheeks. She looked handsome, almost
young again,&#8212;altogether beautiful. The man was
right. She could see that she had succeeded in
getting the best lot in the city. As she stood up
the man stared at her wonderingly. He was a cowboy,&#8212;fringed
trousers, bearskin chaparejos, loose shirt,
broad hat, Mexican spurs, and all.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" he shouted. "It's a woman!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am a woman," answered Sue Belle,
desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm d&#8212;&#8212;d!" he burst out.
</p>

<p>
"You've ordered me away from the lot, but&#8212;&#8212;"
she went on, heedless of his interruption.
</p>

<p>
"Well, gimme a kiss, sis, an' you kin stay on it,"
said the man, with a hideous leer.
</p>

<p>
Sue Belle looked around desperately. She was
practically alone on the prairie save for this man and
the other one, now about a mile distant. The station
and land-office were too far away for her to summon
assistance from them. She was absolutely helpless,
entirely in this man's power.
</p>

<p>
"Will you let me alone if I do?" she asked, at
last.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come, now, you're too pretty to be left alone,
my dear," said the man, coming closer.
</p>

<p>
Resisting the impulse to shriek, she faced him
hatchet in hand. With swift feminine instinct she
comprehended him in a glance. He was just an
ordinary kind of a cowboy, bad when his bad side
was uppermost, but capable of all sorts of nobility
and self-sacrifice if his good side could be reached.
She thought swiftly then,&#8212;she had to. She made
up her mind to appeal to him.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," she said; "don't come nearer until I
speak to you. You're right, I am a woman. I have
a husband and two children. We had a little fortune
which we put into a farm in Cimarron County five
years ago. Through a succession of misfortunes
we've lost every dollar. We have nothing except a
team and this horse. We came down here to try to
get something for our children. Yesterday my husband
fell and broke his arm. He was going to ride
in here. He could not do it. I had to make the
run in place of him. I left him alone, back there on
the edge of the strip, with his broken arm. With
the last ten dollars we had on earth I bought these
boots and employed a negro boy whom I never saw
before to bring my little children after me. I want
this lot. I won it fairly. It's the best lot in the
town. But you are a man; you are stronger than I.
You may&#8212;" she flushed painfully, "kiss me if you
must,&#8212;if you will give me your word of honor that
after that you will leave me this lot. You understand
that I&#8212;I&#8212;only submit to it&#8212;for the sake of
the children and for my poor husband."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were full of tears now, as she clasped
her hands, looked at him appealingly, and waited
with burning face, trembling lips, and heaving
bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Ma'am," said the cowboy, his face also flushing
under his tan, as he took off his sombrero, "I don't
want no kiss. Leastways, I don't take no kiss under
these circumstances. You kin have that there lot.
I jist rode in yere fer the fun of the thing. I don't
want no lot nohow. What'd I do with it? Sell it
fer booze. You beat me on the square, though if it
had been five miles farther I'd a beat you. Them
Kentucky hosses&#8212;I 'low he's a Kentucky hoss?&#8212;ain't
no good fer long-distance runnin' side this flea-bitten
bronc. I don't want no lot noways. You
stay right here on that there lot, an' fer fear less'n
somebody might come along an' try to make you
give it up, I'll stay with you with my gun handy."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you and God bless you," said Sue Belle,
gratefully, looking at him with swimming eyes.
</p>

<p>
Then she put her head down on Kentucky's saddle,
where the horse stood cropping the short grass, threw
her arm around his neck, and sobbed as if her heart
would break. The cowboy surveyed her in astonishment
and terror; but, before he could say anything,
the second man came racing up.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you two young fellows have the best lots
in the place, I suppose. I'll have to take what's
left," said the newcomer, cheerfully. "Great Jupiter!
what's that fellow crying about?"
</p>

<p>
"'Taint a feller," said the cowboy, "it's a female,
a woman."
</p>

<p>
"A woman!" exclaimed the other. "Say, you
cowboy," with an ugly look on his face, "have you
been making a woman cry?"
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a  name="cowboy"><img src="images/007.jpg" alt="&quot;Say, you cowboy, have you been making a woman cry?&quot;" width="500" height="339"></a></div>
<p class="caption">"Say, you cowboy, have you been making a woman cry?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon I hev," answered the cowboy, nonchalantly.
</p>

<p>
"You infernal&#8212;&#8212;" exclaimed the man, stepping
toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Sue Belle, raising her head, "he
didn't. I'm crying for joy!"
</p>

<p>
As he caught sight of her the man bowed instantly
toward her with the grace of a gentleman who recognized
under any accident of clothes a lady.
</p>

<p>
"My husband is ill," said Sue Belle, swiftly divining
another friend, one of another class, too;
"he broke his arm yesterday, and I had to take
our horse and ride here for him and the two little
children, and this gentleman&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Lord!" said the cowboy, "I ain't no gent. I'm
a cow-puncher."
</p>

<p>
"This gentleman came after me and promised to
protect me from everybody. And that is why I
cried."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said the second man, extending his hand,
"I beg your pardon for my suspicions. You are a
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody never called me one before," growled the
cowboy, much embarrassed, shaking the proffered
hand awkwardly but heartily. "I don't care fer no
lot myself an' I'm goin' to hold this lot next to hern
fer the little kids."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's just about what I came for, too.
I'm a student, a senior at Columbia College, New
York, madam," he said, turning to Sue Belle, "out
here for the summer to look after some of my father's
Kansas property. I thought I'd run down here just
for the fun of it. You said you had two children,
did you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Allow me. I will hold the lot on the other side
of you for the other one. So you see, with this
gentleman and myself, you will be surrounded and
protected by the east and the west."
</p>

<p>
Before the afternoon was half gone all the lots in
Newlands had been appropriated, lumber had been
brought in, portable houses and tents erected, saloons
opened, a daily paper started, and the young Bishop
of Oklahoma was on the ground organizing a church;
the place was actually assuming the appearance of a
city even in so short a time. The story of Sue
Belle's ride had been told everywhere by her gallant
flankers, and by common consent the focus of activity
for the city of Newlands was centred about those
three lots. The happy, grateful woman could have
sold them a hundred times at an increasing price had
she chosen to do so.
</p>

<p>
Late in the afternoon Joe came up with the wagon
and the children. He had been faithful to his trust.
Sue Belle was very much frightened when she learned
that her husband had secured a claim. She knew he
would endeavor to hold it, and she feared extremely
for him lying ill and alone on the prairie. Leaving
the children in the care of some of the women who
had followed their husbands on the trail, with the
promise of the whole town that her three lots would
be held inviolate for her, accompanied by her two
faithful, self-constituted guardians, she mounted the
refreshed Kentucky again and rode back to her husband,
lying alone, half delirious, in his shed on the
prairie, clinging desperately to his quarter section.
</p>

<p>
Thus the tide changed at last and now came
flooding in with fortune.

There were but two women in the
camp, Martie was one of them, and
Martie was the cause of it. The statement
that it was on account of her
they quarrelled, and it was through the
quarrel the terrible state of affairs was brought about,
cannot be denied.
</p>

<p>
Martie and her mother&#8212;her mother was the other
woman in the camp, and, except that she had been
responsible for Martie years before, she didn't particularly
count&#8212;had come to the rough little mining
settlement with Martie's father, a mining engineer,
who represented certain speculative holdings in the
East which needed personal attention.
</p>

<p>
Before they arrived the camp had been a fairly
peaceable one: the boys got drunk just about so
often, once in a while there was a shooting affair, but
Medicine Dog was as orderly a camp as might have
been found in Colorado, until Martie came. It
was a serpent, I believe, that introduced the trouble
in the Garden of Eden. I wonder what the wild
beasts thought of the advent of Eve. At any rate,
Martie first reformed and then disorganized Medicine
Dog.
</p>

<p>
Following her arrival there was an ebullition of
"boiled shirts,"&#8212;come by express in response to
telegraphic communications with Denver, the first
evidence of the reform. This was followed by the
influx of a lone Chinaman, imported for the reboiling
of the said shirts, his life, liberty, and the peaceful
pursuit of his vocation over the tubs being guaranteed
him by the camp, the second evidence of the reform.
There was a consequent amelioration of manners,
proportioned to the prevalence of shirt bosom, too.
"Boiled shirts"&#8212;I use the language of the camp&#8212;are
the beginning of that civilization of which "plug
hats" are the end. Medicine Dog never got that
far, except in its dreams; even Martie was not quite
equal to promoting the "plug hat."
</p>

<p>
The saloon, too, felt the good&#8212;or evil, according to
the point of view&#8212;effect of Martie's presence, and
the wonderful part of it was that Big Sam, who dispensed
liquor, profanity, and on occasions, if necessary,
bullets from his "Colt's 45," from behind the
bar, bore the situation philosophically. He was as
much under Martie's sway as anybody else. That
was the last evidence of the reform. And when a
preacher&#8212;a wandering missionary&#8212;came along, Big
Sam cheerfully, if temporarily, suspended business
one Sunday morning and they had services in the
saloon, the preacher on the counter to conduct them,
and Martie on a table where they could all see her,
with a portable organ to lead the singing.
</p>

<p>
That was the only time Martie's presence graced
the saloon. The effect of her presence there was
lasting. The boys could hardly swallow their whiskey
during that or the next day.
</p>

<p>
"It tastes as if it had sugar in it," said Dan Casey,
mournfully, subtly referring to the sweetening effect
of Martie's visit. When it came to choosing between
Martie and whiskey, the difficulties of the situation
were enough to appall the stoutest heart in Medicine
Dog.
</p>

<p>
Casey signified his change of heart in the matter
of clothing by trimming his beard&#8212;there was no
barber in the camp yet&#8212;and by adding a green tie
to his shirt, and when MacBurns appeared with a
yellow silk streamer across his bestarched bosom,
Casey took it as a direct reflection upon his religious
and political views, and for a time Medicine Dog
threatened to resume its pristine liveliness.
</p>

<p>
The quarrel was compromised by Martie; for when
she artfully caused the news to be circulated that she
doted on red or blue ties and could not abide green
or yellow ones, Casey and MacBurns discarded the
colors of their choice and settled the affair by wearing
Martie's.
</p>

<p>
Martie wore those colors herself. She was the
reddest-cheeked, bluest-eyed, and bonniest girl that
had ever come across the mountains, so Medicine
Dog swore unanimously, at any rate. As occasion
served, the various members of the camp maintained
Martie's cause with strenuous and generally fatal
effect to various gentlemen from other camps who
were rashly inclined to question the assertion. Martie
would have shone anywhere in the open air, and in
womanless Medicine Dog she was a heroine, a queen.
That was the beginning of disorganization, too.
</p>

<p>
The two men hardest hit were Jack Elliott and Dick
Sanderson. Elliott was a jolly, happy-go-lucky
fellow born in the East, Sanderson a quieter man
from the middle West, who complemented his companion
admirably. They worked a rich claim together
on the mountain side with good results.
They were steady-going fellows and both were dead
shots with the rifle. They were great-hearted young
men, who loved each other with an affection that
some men develop under certain circumstances for
one another until a woman intervenes. Martie intervened.
Both men fell in love with her, and as
they were men of education,&#8212;being fellow-graduates
of the old University of Pennsylvania,&#8212;they were
not content with the mere blind adoration which the
rest of Medicine Dog exhibited. They wanted
Martie, and as the days grew longer and they knew
her better, they wanted her more and more.
</p>

<p>
Each man dreamed dreams of a house on the
mountain side overlooking the camp with Martie as
its mistress and with himself as titular, if not actual,
master. There had never been a wedding celebrated
in the valley, and they were both united upon the
desirability of having one. Each one, however,
wanted to be the bridegroom!
</p>

<p>
Martie recognized the difference between these two
men and the rest of the camp, although in no way
did they hold themselves aloof from the general
society of Medicine Dog&#8212;that would not have been
tolerated by the rest of the boys. She realized that
either of them might legitimately aspire to her hand,
for they were in an entirely different category from
the rude, humble, faithful adorers like Big Sam and
Casey and the boys, and Martie loved one of them.
</p>

<p>
But Martie was a coquette. It wasn't in a girl of
Martie's temperament to be otherwise in a camp with
a hundred men in love with her, the only other woman
being Martie's mother, and she didn't count when Martie
was around. And by degrees that which neither
of the men wished, which both of them would fain
have avoided, was brought about. There was a
dissolution of partnership, a rupture of old associations,
a shattering of ancient friendship. As is
always the case, where both had loved, they now
hated.
</p>

<p>
I said that they were both good shots with the rifle.
That hardly describes their capacities. If the mine
had failed, they could have earned a fortune on any
vaudeville stage. One of their "stunts"&#8212;as the
boys called it&#8212;was really remarkable. Such was
their confidence in each other that when one balanced
a little can of whiskey on his head and the other
bored a hole through it neatly with his rifle at a distance
of sixty yards and upward the spectators
hardly knew whether to admire the nerve of the can-holder
or that of the marksman the more; although
Casey deprecated the performance on account of the
liability of the whiskey to go to waste! They shot
equally well, and sometimes the one and sometimes the
other held the target. It had grown an old story
to Medicine Dog, but strangers always wanted to see
the feat performed. After the rupture between them
they did it no more, of course.
</p>

<p>
It was Martie who had separated them and it was
Martie who brought them together again. Both men
paid assiduous court to her, and she positively refused
under any circumstances to give either a final
answer until they became friends once more and
swore to accept her decision without prejudice to that
friendship. Martie was a power, and she had her
way.
</p>

<p>
A reconciliation was effected, and the two men
went back to work on their joint claim.
</p>

<p>
Still, Martie hesitated over that decision. Some
intuition told her that no promise would avail against
the satisfaction on the one hand and the disappointment
on the other when she made a choice; but
make it she must, and finally, after much hesitation,
she announced that she chose Sanderson. His joy
could not quite obliterate in her mind the impression
caused by Elliott's grief. Elliott was too much
of a man, however, to make any open outcry. He
believed that if Sanderson had been out of the way
he would have been successful, and his belief was
probably correct; but the matter had been decided,
and he swallowed his disappointment as best he
might and bore Sanderson's triumph in silence.
</p>

<p>
A sporty stranger came to Medicine Dog one day
shortly after the engagement was announced, and the
conversation in the saloon turned upon the marksmanship
of the camp. Medicine Dog prided itself
on the ability of Elliott and Sanderson. The stranger
was incredulous, and wagers were made and the boys
repaired in a body to the Elliott-Sanderson claim
and told of the bets. Neither man was anxious for
the test, but for the honor of the camp, and because
of the disappointment of the boys themselves, they
felt that they could not refuse. Each volunteered to
hold the can and each urged the other to shoot.
Finally they agreed to decide the matter by tossing a
coin,&#8212;the usual method of settling mooted points.
</p>

<p>
Fate appointed Elliott to use the rifle. He seized
the weapon and started up the trail to get his distance.
In that same moment a grim and ghastly
temptation, proportioned in its appeal to the strength
of his passion, entered his soul. If he killed Sanderson
the field would be free. Martie's affections were
not so deeply engaged but that she might be won.
The idea whitened his lips and blanched his face and
shook his hand, and it occurred at the same moment
to Sanderson. He realized, as he walked across the
clearing and backed up against a tree, the possibilities
of the situation, and his own dark face went as white
as that of his companion. But he was game. His
emotion was not fear,&#8212;at least not fear for himself,&#8212;or
if it were fear, it was for Elliott. As he prepared
to receive the shot he prayed&#8212;and he was not a
praying man; nobody much at Medicine Dog was in
the habit of praying then&#8212;that Elliott might be equal
to resisting the terrible demand.
</p>

<p>
As for Elliott, his soul was torn in a perfect
tempest. He could see nothing but the fact that
there before him was the man who had won the
object for which he would have given his soul, that
the man was unarmed, that if he shot him no power
on earth could ever connect him with the crime of
murder, for he could swear that it was an accident.
The best of marksmen sometimes make blunders; all
do not shoot with the continued accuracy of a William
Tell. Satan possessed the man's soul for the moment.
Ay, it was the woman who had tempted the man,&#8212;so
it was in the Garden of Eden,&#8212;but this time a
woman innocent and unwitting. Poor little Martie!
She could not help it, after all.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts crowded the minds of the two
men as they took their stations. Elliott faced Sanderson
and slowly raised his rifle. By a violent effort
he mastered his trembling as he glanced along the polished
barrel and drew the exquisite bead upon the little
black spot on the can where he was to send the bullet.
</p>

<p>
There was something in the air, in the attitude of
the two men, in the situation, which suddenly broke
upon the consciousness of the onlookers. They
shifted uneasily. Finally Big Sam burst out, amid a
chorus of approval:
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, Elliott, don't shoot! You're
not in the mood to-day, old man. We'll willin'ly
lose the bet. Give the stranger his money, boys."
</p>

<p>
It was Sanderson who broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"What are you afraid of, Sam?" he cried, taking
the can in his hands. "By Heaven, the man doesn't
live," he shouted, translating everybody's thought in
his impetuosity, "that dare charge my partner with
foul play!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, of course not," came in expostulation
from the crowd of spectators.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, then," said Sanderson, calmly. "Go
ahead, Jack. I'll trust you."
</p>

<p>
He lifted the can again to his head, folded his
arms, and faced his friend, a little smile on his lips.
</p>

<p>
Once more Elliott lifted his gun, which he had
dropped during the conversation. This time his
nerves were quite steady. He glanced along the
barrel again. Should he send a shot into that smiling
face?&#8212;his friend's face? A moment would determine.
He aimed long and carefully at the target he
had selected.
</p>

<p>
The smile would have died away from Sanderson's
face had he not fixed it there with a horrible effort.
Elliott again so lingered over his aim that the men
once more started to interfere. The tense situation
was more than they could bear. What was the
matter?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the devil that had possessed him released
the miner. Elliott's love for man passed his love for
woman. He forgot Martie as he faced Sanderson.
His courage came back to him and his clearness of
vision.
</p>

<p>
He dropped his rifle, and before any one could
stop him, although Sanderson screamed, "For God's
sake, Jack, don't do it!" and the men surged toward
him, he whipped out his pistol, pointed it at his own
breast, pulled the trigger, and fell bleeding from a
mortal wound through the right lung.
</p>

<p>
"Men," he gasped out brokenly, "you're right&#8212;I
was going to kill&#8212;him&#8212;on account of&#8212;Martie, you
know, but&#8212;but he trusted me and&#8212;I could&#8212;not.
Yet I'm a murderer&#8212;in the&#8212;sight of God&#8212;and my
punishment&#8212;is&#8212;this. Dick&#8212;don't tell Martie."
</p>

<p>
There was a look of peace on his face as they
gathered around him. They drew back a little as
Dick Sanderson knelt down and took him in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, Jack!" he sobbed, "I knew your temptation,
but I knew you wouldn't shoot me, old man.
You were braver than I. I don't know what would
have happened if the coin had flipped my way. Oh,
Jack, I wish to God you had killed me!"
</p>

<p>
"Now&#8212;I'm&#8212;forgiven," whispered Elliott, feebly,
lifting his hand toward the other, and then he smiled,
and then it was all over.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said Sanderson, crying like a baby,
as he rose to his feet, "he died for me."
</p>

<p>
"And for Martie," added Casey.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and for Martie."
</p>

<p>
"Stranger," said Big Sam, turning to the man who
had made the wager, "the money is yourn. I wish
to God we'd never bet!"
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said the stranger, "I don't take no
money from no gents w'ich is won under them circumstances,
but if you gents'll come down to the
saloon and likker with me&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"That's handsome of you, stranger, but we don't
none of us git no likker in this camp to-day. That
there saloon closes in Medicine Dog until arter the
funeral of the finest and whitest-hearted gentleman
and the best shot that ever lived in this camp," said
Big Sam, turning mournfully away.

I.&#8212;AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
</p>

<p>
There wasn't a harder body of fighters
in the army of the United States than
"Kirke's Lambs." The only resemblance
between this modern regiment
and the famous body of horse which
divided dishonors with Jeffreys after Sedgemoor,
nearly two hundred years before, was in the name of
their commander, for they were held under too iron
a rule to degenerate into brutal and ferocious excesses.
Besides, Kirke and the generals he served
under always gave that body of hard riders plenty to
do, so that they found an easy vent for their superfluous
energies in legitimate fighting,&#8212;if any can be
so called.
</p>

<p>
Kirke had grown up with the regiment from a
subaltern to the colonel. Drafts had restored its depleted
members from time to time, but in the spring
of 1865 the Civil War was about over, and it was not
considered necessary to complete its quota by an infusion
of new blood then. There was but a handful
of them left, therefore. The others&#8212;well, they said
the bodies of "Kirke's Lambs" blazed a pathway
from the Mississippi to the sea.
</p>

<p>
Kirke was an iron man everywhere and in everything,&#8212;in
his business, in his regiment, and in his
family, which now consisted of one solitary woman.
The single child who had blessed the union had
died before the war. The woman had been left
alone for over four years. Kirke had never left the
front and what he conceived to be his duty. He was
a reticent, self-contained, undemonstrative man, whose
affection made no show on the surface, though the
current of it ran very still and deep. He actually
idolized the woman who bore his name and had
borne his son. On the death of that son he had
made no great display of grief, though it cut him
to the heart; and in general he gave little outward
evidence of any strong affection to the poor, weak
wife left so much alone and pining, like every woman
in a like case.
</p>

<p>
She was a nervous, high-strung little body, utterly
unable to see beneath the outward show; not strong
enough to fathom Kirke's depths,&#8212;her heart was too
light a plummet,&#8212;and it was a wonder to Jack Broadhead,
who was Kirke's dearest friend and the second
in command of the "Lambs," how she ever inspired
the devotion that he, with better insight, divined that
Kirke cherished for her.
</p>

<p>
Well, what was left of the regiment was out scouting. It had been ordered to clear up the remains of
a Carolina brigade of Confederates which had been
making things pleasant for the left flank of Sherman's
army all the way to the sea and afterwards. One
morning in February a party of some two hundred
and fifty troopers, all that was left of the "Lambs,"
galloped over a rough road up a narrow valley
toward the base of a buttress-like, tree-clad hill, upon
the top of which lay ensconced the remains of that
brigade.
</p>

<p>
They called it a brigade in the Confederate army,
but it was really no more of a brigade than were
some of Washington's during the Revolution: it was
a handful of perhaps one hundred and fifty desperate,
half-starved, ragged men, whose rifles and the
bronzed, tense look of the hunted veteran at bay
alone proclaimed them soldiers. They lay snug
behind a hastily improvised breastwork on the crest
of the hill. And they had retreated just as far as
they intended to go. This was the limit.
</p>

<p>
Above them from an impromptu tree-trunk staff
flapped and fluttered a ragged and tattered Confederate
flag,&#8212;their last. They might have retreated
farther, but to have gone northward would have thrown
them into the arms of a division ranging the country,
which would mean their annihilation or, if they scattered,
their disintegration. Kirke had been pursuing
them for a day or two. They knew his detachment,
and in a spirit of reckless pugnacity they determined
to have one good, square, stand-up fight before they
quit the game, which everybody now knew was a
losing one from the Confederate stand-point, with the
inevitable end in plain sight. They had fought together
during four years; they would fight together
once more, let the end be what it would. A dangerous
crowd to tackle.
</p>

<p>
With a skill which should have been manipulating
an army, Hoyle, the brigadier-general in command of
the remains, had disposed his men so that there was
only one practicable way to attack them, and that was
straight up the mountain. Their flanks were protected
by ravines, and their rear could not be come
at save by a d&#233;tour of many miles over the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Kirke, halting his men at the foot of the hill,
realized the situation as soon as he saw it. Could
they take the hill by a direct front attack in the face
of such a body of men, desperate old soldiers, who
could shoot as straight and as fast as the remnants of
that brigade could? Yet what else was there to do?
He could not retire; he had been directed to put
that brigade out of action, capture, or destroy it.
He could not besiege it and starve it out. It was a
problem.
</p>

<p>
While he was hesitating, Jack Broadhead, who
had been left behind at head-quarters for a day, came
galloping up with a few troopers as his escort. His
quick, soldierly eye took in the desperate situation.
After the necessary salutes had been exchanged a
little conversation took place.
</p>

<p>
"That is a strong position, Bob."
</p>

<p>
"It is that, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"That fellow is a soldier, every inch of him."
</p>

<p>
"We knew that before."
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Well, what are you going to do about it?"
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know. Think we can take it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know. Looks dubious. But we've
got a crowd here that will storm hell itself, if somebody
leads, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I'll lead, but this is worse than hell."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by the way," Broadhead burst out, as a
flash of recollection came to him, "I have a letter
for you. It came just as I was leaving head-quarters."
</p>

<p>
He fumbled in the breast of his jacket, and as
Kirke stretched out his hand indifferently he gave
him the letter. The man's face changed slightly. A
look of softness mitigated the iron aspect of his visage.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he said, in a rarely communicative moment,
"from my wife."
</p>

<p>
He tore it open. A glance put him in possession
of its contents. Again his face changed. It was
hard and grim at best, but never, thought Broadhead,
as he watched him, had he exhibited a grimmer and
harder look than at this moment. And there was
a gleam almost of agony in the man's eyes. His lips
trembled,&#8212;and for Kirke's lips to tremble was a
thing unheard of! Broadhead saw him clench his
teeth together and by a mighty effort regain his self-control.
During the struggle he had crushed the
letter in his hand.
</p>

<p>
After a minute he unclosed his fingers, smoothed
out the paper, took out his pencil, and wrote a brief
endorsement upon the bottom of it, signed his name,
folded it up, and thrust it in the pocket of his coat.
</p>

<p>
"If anything happens to me, Broadhead,"&#8212;and
there was a harsher ring than usual in his voice,&#8212;"this
letter is to go back&#8212;to&#8212;to my&#8212;the writer."
</p>

<p>
"Very good," said Broadhead, who knew his
superior too well to question him as to what had
occurred. "I take it that you have decided to attack?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Men," said Kirke, wheeling his horse and
facing the iron veterans who had come to love him as
few soldiers were ever loved by their men, "there is
that rebel brigade on the top of that hill,&#8212;what's
left of them. You know what they are. We have
tested their mettle in a dozen fights. Now we have
to wipe them out. It is probable that a large part of
us will be wiped out in the process, but that's no
matter. Dismount and tie the horses. We want
every man in action. Leave your sabres. We'll
depend upon carbines and revolvers. We'll go up
and pull that flag off that hill. The trees will cover
us till we get near the crest. Halt there, form up,
and make a rush for it. Save your fire until you get
to the top."
</p>

<p>
The cheer that came in response was more like the
growl of an angry animal. The men instantly followed
the example of their leader and dismounted.
Their horses were tied to the trees and saplings in the
valley, and the men, circling the hill in a long line
with Kirke in the centre and well in the lead, followed
by Broadhead a short distance after, began to
move up the slope through the trees.
</p>

<p>
It was still as death at the top. There was no
sign of life there save the flag which rippled and
fluttered gayly in the breeze. It was a bright, sunny
morning. The cool touch of spring in the air made life
sweet to all that possessed it. In the grim silence the
men clambered up the steep slope and slowly neared
the crest. Suddenly there was a puff of white smoke
from the little log breastwork on the top. A moment
later the crack of a rifle rolled down the hill, and the
man nearest Kirke fell on the slope, rolled against a
tree, and lay still. He had rashly exposed himself,
and he was gone. They were good shots, those
Johnnies.
</p>

<p>
The men as they advanced sought instinctively such
cover as they could, skipping from tree to tree. Every
once in a while, however, one of them would expose
himself in the open, and the exposure was always followed
by a shot which more than once caught its mark.
The crest was bare of trees, and the command arrived
at the edge of the clearing with some loss, and cautiously
concentrated, hesitating a moment before
breaking out into the open and rushing the hill.
</p>

<p>
"Now, men," said Kirke, "you see what we have
to do. The quicker we do it the better for us. Give
me that flag," he added, turning to the color-bearer.
"Gibson,"&#8212;to his bugler,&#8212;"stand by to sound the
charge when I give the signal."
</p>

<p>
There was nothing dramatic about Kirke, it was
all a matter of pure business with him; but the men
thought they had never seen so splendid a figure as he
when he tore off his cap, jerked his revolver from his
belt, seized the flag with his left hand, and stepped
out in the open.
</p>

<p>
He nodded his head to the alert Gibson, and the
shrill notes of the charge echoed through the hills.
Ere it had died away the men heard their colonel
say, "Come on!"
</p>

<p>
It was always Kirke's way to say "Come" rather
than "Go."
</p>

<p>
With a mighty roar they sprang from the shelter of
the trees and dashed for the ridge. A terrific volley
greeted them. With a crash like thunder, which
echoed and re-echoed through the hills, the Confederate
fire was poured upon them. Had it not been
that most of the men, firing down the hill, overshot
the mark, the "Lambs" would have been blown into
eternity. As it was, many of them fell, but the rest
plunged dauntlessly into the smoke through which
the red of the flag could dimly be discerned waving
in the advance.
</p>

<p>
Again the rifles of the brigade cracked out, and
this time sent their messengers of death crashing full
into the face of Kirke's men. This time the carnage
was terrible; there were many dead, but the blood
of the living was up: they would have charged a
moving express train. They tore recklessly through
the smoke toward the top, following the flag.
</p>

<p>
Before the rifles could be reloaded the "Lambs"
were at the breastwork, Kirke still in the lead. To
leap the log walls was the work of a moment. The
brigade was ready for them. The carbines cracked
again and again; there was a grim, ghastly, awful
struggle on the top of that hill around the foot of
the Confederate flag-staff&#8212;then silence.
</p>

<p>
When the fighting stopped the few "Lambs" who
were left leaned panting on their carbines, blood
dripping from the gunstocks, surveying the tangled
mass of dead and dying. The brigade had been annihilated.
</p>

<p>
Broadhead sprang to the staff to haul down the
flag. He was nonplussed to find that there were no
halliards, and that some one had evidently climbed a
tree, which had been denuded of its limbs for the
purpose, and nailed the flag there. He turned to
look for Kirke, when, in the smoke that yet covered
the field, he distinctly saw the man lift his revolver,
pull its trigger, and blow out his brains.
</p>

<p>
In the confusion after the little battle, fortunately,
no one noticed the action but himself. He was
utterly at a loss to fathom the meaning of the suicide,
but he quickly resolved that no one should know of it.
</p>

<p>
They buried the brigade with the dead "Lambs"
around the foot of the staff, and Broadhead left the
flag flying above them. He might have chopped
down the tree and taken it, but it seemed fitting
that the men who had defended it should have that
last honor. The wind would whip it out in a day or
two at best. Taking their wounded, they retraced
their steps as they could, thinking that Kirke had
been killed in the action, an opinion which Broadhead's
report sedulously fostered. Broadhead carefully
preserved Kirke's revolver, which he took from
his dead hand, the letter, which he found in his breast
pocket, his watch and sword, and a lock of his black
curly hair.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
II.&#8212;IN THE ROOM IN THE NIGHT
</p>

<p>
When the war was over, and they were mustered
out soon afterwards, Broadhead hastened to Philadelphia
and drove immediately to Kirke's house. It
was empty. There was no sign of life about it. As
he stopped on the doorstep in the late afternoon,
wondering vaguely what had happened and what he
should do next, the door of the adjoining house
opened and a woman came out, of whom he made
inquiry for Mrs. Kirke.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Kirke!" said the woman, in surprise. "And
who may you be, may I ask?"
</p>

<p>
"I am&#8212;I was&#8212;Colonel Kirke's dearest friend."
</p>

<p>
"Is Colonel Kirke dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And a good thing, too," said the woman.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," cried Broadhead, indignantly, "do you
realize what you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I do. Don't you know about Mrs.
Kirke?"
</p>

<p>
"No. Is she dead?"
</p>

<p>
"It would be better if she were," she answered.
"She ran away two months ago with a man named
Allen, and after she left she sent me a letter enclosing
the key of her house and requesting that I give it to
Colonel Kirke when he returned from the war. So
long as he is gone, I guess you might as well have it.
Wait; I'll fetch it."
</p>

<p>
The woman turned back into the house as she
spoke. This, thought Broadhead, sadly, was the explanation of it all. That letter. He had never examined
it. He had held it sacred, but now he felt that
he must open it. It might give him some clew as to
the whereabouts of the woman. Yet he hesitated.
</p>

<p>
When the woman gave him the key he entered the
lonely house. He went upstairs and sat down in
Kirke's study, and there, overcoming his hesitation,
he read the letter. It was the letter of a weak, hysterical
woman, reproaching her husband for his lack
of love, his seeming neglect, for her loneliness, and
ended by saying that she had gone off with a man
who loved her, and that he should never see her
again. Kirke's endorsement was brief and as terse
as the man's character.
</p>

<p>
"I have been to blame," he had written. "I did
love you. I do. God only knows how much. I
hope you may be happy. We are about to attack a
strong position. I feel sure that after it is over I
shall trouble you no more. You can marry the
man&#8212;damn him!&#8212;and be happy."
</p>

<p>
How characteristic that was, thought Jack Broadhead,
as he read,&#8212;that last touch! He cursed the
man yet spared the woman. For a long time Broadhead
sat there in that house, thinking, thinking,
thinking. He wondered if he were the only mourner
for poor Kirke. The twilight and then the darkness
came stealing over the town, and still he sat there.
By and by he heard a step&#8212;a hesitant, faltering step&#8212;in
the hallway. He remembered now that he had
left the street door open. He sat still and listened.
The step mounted the stairs. It came along the
short hall and stopped at the entrance of the library.
He sat by the open window. The wandering figure
was that of a woman. She saw the soldier silhouetted
in the darkness against the light from the street
lamp outside.
</p>

<p>
"Robert! Robert!" she cried. "You have come
back! Thank God!"
</p>

<p>
Broadhead rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, quietly, "it is not Colonel Kirke."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Broadhead!" exclaimed the woman.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mrs.&#8212;Mrs.&#8212;er&#8212;Allen, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" she shrieked, shrinking back. "My&#8212;my
husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean Colonel Kirke?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. I have no other."
</p>

<p>
"And Allen?"
</p>

<p>
"He has cast me off, turned me away."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you heard?"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard nothing. I have been blind&#8212;in
hell&#8212;since&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know."
</p>

<p>
"But Robert?"
</p>

<p>
"He is dead."
</p>

<p>
The woman sank into a chair, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
"When? How? Did he get my letter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. He was killed at the capture of a little hill
in North Carolina on the day he received your letter.
Here it is."
</p>

<p>
"Did he say anything before&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"There is a message written in it."
</p>

<p>
"Give it me."
</p>

<p>
Striking a light at the gas-bracket, Broadhead
handed her the letter. She read it through dry-eyed
while he watched her. She had been a pretty, sweet,
dainty, attractive-looking little woman, now she was
a haggard, broken wreck.
</p>

<p>
"And he was killed by the enemy?" she asked at last.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said Broadhead, sternly, "you shall
hear the truth. He shot himself on the top of the
hill the day of the battle with this revolver," laying
the weapon on the table. "Here is his sword and
his watch and a lock of his hair. I suppose you
don't care for them."
</p>

<p>
"I care for everything that belonged to him more
than Heaven itself."
</p>

<p>
"You are free now," said Broadhead; "you can
marry your&#8212;your&#8212;friend."
</p>

<p>
"Never! He has driven me away, cast me off,
and I hate him! I hated him from the very moment&#8212;I
shall be free, anyway. He said nothing before
he died?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"And this is all you can tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"All."
</p>

<p>
"Will you leave me now?"
</p>

<p>
"What? Alone in this empty house?"
</p>

<p>
"It's my house, isn't it? I am still Mrs. Kirke,
am I not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course, but&#8212;I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Will you go, please? You have discharged your
errand. You have told me the dreadful truth. For
God's sake, leave me!"
</p>

<p>
"May I not do something&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing,&#8212;nothing. You may come back to-morrow
morning and advise what to do. I am alone
now, you see."
</p>

<p>
Broadhead stood uncertainly before her.
</p>

<p>
"Go, go!" she pleaded. "Don't you see that I
wish to be alone for a little? You have been very
good to me. I thank you."
</p>

<p>
She hesitatingly put out her hand to him.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you shake hands with me?" she pleaded.
"I did very wrong. I fell very low. But I am very
sorry."
</p>

<p>
Upon an impulse for which he rejoiced ever after,
Broadhead clasped the thin, tiny hand in his own,
held it a moment, bent low over it, and, with old-fashioned
gallantry, kissed it,&#8212;that soiled, wasted
hand!
</p>

<p>
"I forgive you," he said, and the voice of the
dead seemed to speak to the woman through his
lips.
</p>

<p>
He turned and left her alone,&#8212;alone in the darkness,
alone with her memories, alone with her sorrow,
alone with her repentance, alone with the weapon.
</p>

<p>
She lifted the heavy revolver with trembling hand.
There was a single cartridge left in the chamber.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, in great anxiety, Broadhead
came back to the house. He found the woman sitting
quite white and still where he had left her, and
the revolver was empty!

I.&#8212;THE CONDITION
</p>

<p>
"I am a passed midshipman now, Dorothy dear,
and I'm certain to get my swab&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Swab, Mr. Maurice?" interrupted the
young lady, archly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my epaulet&#8212;a lieutenant's commission&#8212;this
year; you know what I mean, Miss Venour.
And, oh, I do love you so! With my pay and what
father will allow me and what your grandfather will
allow you we can get along,&#8212;that is, if you love me
well enough to try it."
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause. The young lady looked
down at her feet, while the arm of the young man
stole around her waist. Tired at last of waiting,
though the position was a charming one, the young
officer recalled her to herself by a slight squeeze,
which was answered by a delightful little shriek from
the girl.
</p>

<p>
"What was it you were saying?" she asked, hurriedly
drawing away.
</p>

<p>
"I was telling you that I loved you," he answered
with dignity, releasing her, "and asking you to marry
me when I got to be a lieutenant, if you love me.
You do, don't you, Dorothy?" abandoning his stateliness
and bending toward her entreatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Ye&#8212;es, I&#8212;I&#8212;I think so, Mr. Maurice&#8212;James,
then," she continued, in compliance with a deprecatory
wave of his hand, "or Jim&#8212;or&#8212;" she hesitated
a moment and added the word "dear."
</p>

<p>
His face brightened. He sprang toward her in
boyish delight; but she checked his rush with a
pretty little motion, and continued, calmly,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"You are a very nice boy indeed, but you are so
young, you know&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Young!" he replied; "I am nineteen, and you
are only seventeen yourself! You are scarcely old
enough to be married."
</p>

<p>
"I am," she said, promptly; "I am old enough
for anything."
</p>

<p>
"Old enough for me, Dot? Say, 'Yes!' You
know I'm sure to come out a lieutenant from this
cruise, and then you will be a year older, too, you
know, and&#8212;oh, Dot, do take me! You'd better
take me now, you know; you might not have a
chance next year. I've been wounded once, and
something tells me&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
He paused gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim," she cried, "don't speak of it! But
grandfather will never consent. You know perfectly
well a lieutenant's pay does not amount to anything,
and&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"You are right there, Dot," broke in a deep voice,
as a stout, red-faced old man in the uniform of a
captain in the navy came strolling out upon the beach
from behind a clump of rocks.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Venour!" exclaimed the young officer,
starting back in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, grandfather, you have been listening! How
shocking!" cried Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"Listening!" snorted the old man, contemptuously,
with a nice mixture of metaphors; "why, this young
calf here has been roaring out his love like the bulls
of Bashan."
</p>

<p>
"Sir&#8212;sir!" exclaimed Maurice, flushing painfully,
"I love your granddaughter&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Stale news, lad. Everybody within half a mile
of this knows it now," said the old man. "Why, the
smack of your&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather!" interrupted Dorothy, promptly,
emulating her lover's blush.
</p>

<p>
"And I want to marry her, sir, with your permission."
</p>

<p>
"Marry her!" shouted Captain Venour. "On the
pay of a midshipman! You young&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a passed midshipman now, sir," interrupted
Maurice, "and I'm sure to be a lieutenant when I
come back from this cruise to the West Indies,&#8212;and
she says she loves me and that she will wait; didn't
you, Dot?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Venour, sir!" roared the old man, "in my
presence! Did you make any foolish promises to
this young man, Dorothy?"
</p>

<p>
"I&#8212;ye&#8212;es, sir; I said I&#8212;I'd&#8212;I'd wait," answered
Dorothy, reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes? Well, you will; you'll wait until he gets
to be a captain. A man isn't fit to be married until
he has had command of a ship and three or four
hundred men; he doesn't know how to manage a
wife. Look at me! I married when I was a midshipman
and&#8212;and&#8212;I know."
</p>

<p>
"But, sir, it will be fifteen years before I am a
captain! Why, you weren't a captain yourself until
you were forty, and I can never hope to equal your
record."
</p>

<p>
"No more you won't," said the old man, somewhat
mollified by the adroit compliment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, grandfather, not forty years! We couldn't
wait until then! Why, I'm only seventeen now, sir,
and James&#8212;Mr. Maurice&#8212;is only nineteen. Please,
sir&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy dropped on her knees on the sand before
him, and at a motion of her hand Maurice did likewise.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, get up, you young fools!" said the old
man; "suppose some one should see us!"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," said Dorothy, grasping the skirts of his
coat tightly; "not until you modify your terms.
You know he loves me, and&#8212;and&#8212;and I am so
sorry for him," she added, ingenuously.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the captain, to whom Dorothy was
as the apple of his eye, "I'll knock off a little. He
can marry you when he has command of a ship. If
he is lucky, he might be made a lieutenant-commandant
in five years. Now, up with you!"
</p>

<p>
The young people struggled to their feet and
looked sadly at each other.
</p>

<p>
"Five years!" ejaculated the midshipman, mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"It's better than twenty, Jim," said Dorothy,
cheerfully. "Can't you wait?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait! I will wait forever, Dot, I love you
so&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Waugh!" roared the old captain, "are you going
on with these proceedings before my very eyes, at
my age? It's indecent! There," he added, turning
his back to them and walking away a few steps, at
the same time pulling an old silver watch from his
pocket, "I'll give you just five minutes; and take
my advice, youngster, when you cut out a prize
under convoy of a ship-of-the-line, don't make so
much noise about it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll get a command inside of a year, Dot darling,
or die in trying," whispered the young man.
</p>

<p>
"I would rather have you alive without a command
than dead with one, Jim," remarked Dorothy through
her tears as the old captain came back toward them.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I take it, you have just about time to make
the harbor around yonder point where your ship is
waiting for you," he said. "You've said your good-bys,
and you've got your answer, so you'd better up
anchor and make a run for it. I'll take care Dot
keeps her word, and mind you keep yours! Good-by and good luck to you. If you are half as impudent
in the face of the enemy as you have been to
me here, you will get the ship in a week."
</p>

<p>
The young midshipman clasped the proffered hand
of the retired old sea-captain, wrung it warmly, looked
longingly at Dorothy dissolved in tears on her grandfather's
shoulder, and then turned and made his way
slowly down the beach toward the town and the
harbor.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
II.&#8212;THE UNDERTAKING
</p>

<p>
H. B. M.'s ship-of-the-line <i>Centaur</i>, 74, Captain
Murray Maxwell, flying the broad pennant of Commodore
Samuel Hood, was cruising to and fro off
the island of Martinique, in front of Fort Royal
Bay, to blockade the port and capture in- and out-bound
vessels. One afternoon in the month of
January, 1804, the commodore and the captain were
standing at the break of the poop discussing a
problem. They had just been in chase of a fast-sailing
French frigate, which had escaped them by
boldly running under the lee of Diamond Rock,
whither, through ignorance of the channel and want
of pilots, they dared not follow. The thing had
happened half a dozen times in the past month, and
the commodore naturally was exasperated.
</p>

<p>
The rock itself was a huge mass of naked stone,
about a mile in circumference at the base, and towering
out of the water to a height of some six hundred
feet, in shape resembling a rounded haystack. On
the southward side the rock, sloping precipitously
down to the water's edge, was absolutely unscalable.
The east and southwestern sides were so broken as to
be equally inaccessible, and the breakers, smashing
with tremendous force on the western end, made
landing difficult or impossible. The officer of the
watch that afternoon, who happened to be our quondam
midshipman, James Wilkes Maurice, who had,
by a series of fortunate accidents and some gallantry
as well, been appointed a lieutenant a month since,
could not help overhearing the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"It's too bad!" said the commodore. "The
scoundrels get under the lee of that rock every time
and make a harbor, and I don't see how we can prevent
it unless we get a battery of heavy guns up on
the rock; but there appears to be no way up."
</p>

<p>
"If you please, sir," said Maurice, turning about
and saluting in great trepidation, for the junior lieutenant
was a very small man indeed beside the commodore,
"there is a way up, sir. When I was a
reefer on the <i>Cerberus</i> she was cruising around here,
and one calm day a party of us received permission
to go ashore on that pile of stone, and we managed
to reach the top."
</p>

<p>
"Oho!" exclaimed the commodore, his eyes brightening.
"And could you take a gun up?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the way we went, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I am afraid your experience will not
be of service."
</p>

<p>
"But, sir, if I might make so bold, sir&#8212;&#8212;" continued
the junior lieutenant, hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Heave ahead! Out with it!" said the commodore.
</p>

<p>
"In calm weather, sir, there is no surf on that
point, and it would be quite possible, I should think,
to take the <i>Centaur</i> in close to the shore, and then
with a hawser and a traveller from the main-topmast
head we might make shift to land some guns."
</p>

<p>
"Capital!" exclaimed the commodore. "What
do you think of it, Maxwell?"
</p>

<p>
"It is for you to say, sir," replied the cautious
captain. "The weather is fine enough to-day, and
we might try it. It will be risking His Majesty's
ship, though, sir," he remarked, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Fetch me a glass," said Sir Samuel, turning to
the midshipman of the watch. When it was brought
to him he took a long look at the base of the cliff,
observing a little stretch of sandy beach, upon which
the breakers usually tumbled with tremendous fury.
This morning, fortunately, it seemed calm.
</p>

<p>
"I will answer, sir, that there is deep water under
the cliff," ventured Maurice at this moment.
</p>

<p>
"Will you answer for the flag-ship, too, sir?" asked
the commodore, keenly.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to answer for that myself," he continued.
"We'll try it, Captain Maxwell; the wind's
off shore, the sea smooth as a mill-pond. We'll
anchor the <i>Centaur</i> close under the lee of the rock
off the west side there. Call away a boat. Let Mr.
Maurice go in charge, and I myself will accompany
him. We'll examine into the situation."
</p>

<p>
The investigation under the commodore proved the
practicability of the bold scheme proposed by the
young lieutenant. The <i>Centaur</i> was anchored close
under the lee of the cliff, and with incredible labor
five of her big guns&#8212;three long twenty-four-pounders
and two eighteen-pounders&#8212;were landed on the rock.
One end of a heavy cable was fastened to the main-topmast
and the other was secured to the top of the
cliff. Up this by means of a traveller the heavy guns
were dragged. One of the twenty-four-pounders had
been fitted upon a circular carriage commanding the
landing-place, another was mounted on the northeast
side, and the third upon a platform about midway up
the rock. The two eighteen-pounders were planted
on the very summit and commanded an immense distance.
When the commodore had decided to undertake
the manning of the rock, Maurice had sought
an interview with him and explained his reason for
aspiring to the command of the landing party, which
would, in the natural course of events, be given to a
much older man.
</p>

<p>
"So your marriage with little Dot Venour depends
on your commanding something with a pennant fluttering
above, does it? Lord!" roared the commodore,
bursting into deep sea laughter, "and you want
to hoist your juvenile broad pennant on this rock,
and then you'll want to claim all sorts of privileges,
you young dog! I didn't think that baby was old
enough to be married yet, nor you either. Get
along with you! I don't know what my old friend
Venour would say if I'd be a party to this mad purpose
of yours by giving you the command of this
expedition. There, lad, go to your duty; I'll think
about it," added the commodore, exploding with
mirth again.
</p>

<p>
He thought so well about it, however, that when
all preparations had been made, to the very great
disgust of the older officers of the ship, he detailed
Maurice to the command of the party. On account
of his lack of rank, his junior officers were all midshipmen.
He and the four midshipmen and one
hundred and twenty men and boys, including some
of the best seamen, composed the landing party,
with four months' supply of provisions and ammunition.
As the <i>Centaur</i> got under way and beat up
toward Fort Royal, Maurice tore open an envelope
the commodore had handed him when he bade him
good-by. It was a commission and orders to command
H. B. M.'s sloop-of-war <i>Diamond Rock</i>, five
guns and one hundred and twenty men! He almost
fell over the precipice in surprise and delight at the
situation.
</p>

<p>
The rock was entirely barren except on the north-west
side, where a little depression existed in which
there was a group of stunted wild fig-trees. There
were two or three caves half-way up to the summit,
dry and airy, the floors covered with fine sand, of
which the officers chose the smallest, the men another,
and all hands made themselves very much at
home. The crew was divided into watches, a station
bill made out, lookouts appointed, and the regular
routine of a man-of-war begun.
</p>

<p>
They had not long to wait to demonstrate their
usefulness. Two days after the departure of the
<i>Centaur</i> the lookout on the top of the rock saw a
frigate under a tremendous press of canvas endeavoring
to run between the rock and the shore and make
for Fort Royal. Far away, and coming along like a
gigantic white cloud, was a ship which was presently
made out to be the <i>Centaur</i>. A drummer-boy, not
the least important member of the crew of the <i>Diamond
Rock</i>, beat to quarters, the men sprang to their
stations, and the huge guns were loaded and carefully
trained on the unsuspicious French ship. She came
booming along at a terrific pace. Maurice, with a
coolness remarkable in one so young, waited until
she was well in range, and then, taking careful aim,
with the long twenty-four half-way up the summit,
ignited the priming.
</p>

<p>
With a terrific roar the ball sped straight to its
mark. They were too far away to hear the crash as
it struck the fore-topmast, but the fall of the mast
and the confusion on the ship were plainly visible.
With hearty British cheers the rest of the battery let
drive at the oncoming frigate. One of the eighteens
carried away the jib-stay and the jib-halliards. There
was great consternation on the French frigate. No
one had dreamed of an enemy in that quarter, and
before they could make up their minds what to do a
second broadside was poured upon them from the
rock. Clearly the pass was untenable. The captain
of the frigate was a good seaman, and he promptly
turned about and made for the sea again. He hoped
to escape the <i>Centaur</i> by his speed, but the old ship-of-the-line
had the wind and heels of him now and
she came rushing down upon the frigate. After a
long pursuit and a gallant endeavor the French captain
found himself under the <i>Centaur's</i> guns. There
was nothing to do but to surrender. Throwing a prize
crew on board, the <i>Centaur</i> ran off toward the rock.
When near enough to be seen a string of flags fluttered
out from the mizzen-topgallant yard-arm, and
the delighted youngsters on the rock read the following:
</p>

<p>
"Well done, Captain Maurice!"
</p>

<p>
The men on the <i>Centaur</i> might have almost heard
the cheers with which the men and boys on the rock
greeted the signal. It had leaked out somehow that
the young lieutenant whom they all loved, and to
whose forethought the manning of the rock was due,
was in some way fighting for his sweetheart as well as
his country, and, above all men, the sailor loves a
lover.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely a week passed without a brush with the
enemy, and some months elapsed before the French
learned that the passage which they had used with
so much skill and success was finally closed to them,
and, save at night, no vessels attempted the channel&#8212;not
many then. There had been plenty of excitement
during this period, but now all was changed.
The <i>Centaur</i> and other ships sailed away, and the
crew on the rock had little or no communication with
the shore for over a year longer. Their provisions
and water were replenished every quarter by a
frigate, which was despatched for the purpose.
Otherwise they seemed to have been forgotten. The
novelty of the situation had worn off, and the monotony
had begun to pall upon them dreadfully. Maurice
and his young officers were at their wit's end to
find employment for the men and keep them in good
spirits. The discipline was, of course, sternly maintained,
but, sailor-like, the men tired of the shore and
pined for the unsteady deck of a ship; in addition,
Maurice longed for Dorothy. He had not been able
to send a word, nor had he received a line from that
young lady. He was too proud to write to the commodore
by one of the provisioning ships, and ask
for relief.
</p>

<p>
One evening about the middle of May, 1805, when
the provision-ship was about due on its quarterly trip,
the watchers on the rock saw a great fleet of sixteen
sail-of-the-line, seven frigates, three corvettes, and a
number of smaller vessels, all flying the French flag,
running through the channel toward Fort Royal.
With joy in their hearts at the opportunity for action,
the five guns on the stony sloop-of-war promptly
opened fire upon the great French and Spanish fleet
of M. de Villeneuve, who was prosecuting his attempt
to befool Nelson by giving him that mad chase across
the Atlantic and back which ended at Trafalgar.
</p>

<p>
The French ships returned the fire as they came
within range of the rock, and their tremendous broadsides
kicked up a deal of noise and cut up the face
of the rock somewhat, but did no other damage.
The crew of the rock made excellent practice, and,
considering their force, rendered the passage interesting
to the French. The ennui of the intervening
months was forgotten. Villeneuve was furious.
Never before had one lieutenant, four midshipmen,
and one hundred-odd men (some of them had died
during the sojourn) engaged successfully a splendid
fleet of line-of-battle-ships. Toward evening one
belated Spanish ship unsuspiciously attempted to
anchor near the rock, but she was soon driven off
with much loss. The elated Englishmen saw the
fleet anchor at Fort Royal, now called, in deference
to the republican form of government of France,
Fort de France. Villeneuve, who was furiously
angry, learned from the French at Fort de France
that the formidable barrier was held by a handful of
men, so he determined to capture the rock, and for
that purpose, on the 29th of May, he detached a
squadron consisting of the <i>Pluton</i> and <i>Berwick</i>, 74's,
the frigate <i>Sirene</i>, 36, the <i>Argus</i>, 16, an armed
schooner, and eleven gun-boats under the command
of Commodore Cosmao, of the <i>Pluton</i>, with four
hundred troops-of-the-line.
</p>

<p>
The rock had been blockaded ever since the arrival
of the fleet at Martinique. When Maurice saw
the ships bearing down upon him at break of day on
the 31st of June, 1805, he knew what to expect.
Owing to the fact that the supply-ship, which was
due, had not arrived,&#8212;because of the blockade,
doubtless, and the presence of the great French
fleet,&#8212;Maurice unfortunately found himself with but
a scanty supply of powder and shot. He determined
to abandon two of the lower guns and concentrate
his force about the eighteen-pounders and the twenty-four-pounder half-way up. Spiking the lower guns,
thus destroying the battery, he withdrew to the summit
of his command. For two days the ships were
anchored near by, the mild weather permitting them
to come close in. During this period the French
poured an unremitting hail of shot upon the stone
batteries of the rocky vessel. Maurice and his men
answered the fire slowly but with great precision from
their three remaining guns. Three of the gun-boats
and two other small boats were sunk, and the larger
ships were much cut up. The young captain might
have protracted his defence indefinitely had not his
powder entirely failed him. Observing the English
fire to slacken, the French finally landed their troops
on the beach at the foot of the rock. The last
charge of the twenty-four hurled its iron missive of
death among the Frenchmen huddled on the beach.
Then, like a flock of goats, they sprang at the cliffs
and clambered up the steep sides of the rock, which
the fire of the ships cleared with showers of grape-shot.
A feeble musketry-fire, for the small cartridges
had been torn to contribute powder for the great
guns, met them, but they came boldly on. As they
swarmed over the rock Maurice and some of the
older men struck at the advancing French with their
swords. The two men nearest him were killed and
he himself was badly wounded. There was nothing
left but surrender. A French officer hauled down
the English flag. The young captain had lost his
first command. H. B. M.'s sloop-of-war <i>Diamond
Rock</i> had passed into the hands of Admiral Villeneuve.
</p>

<p>
When the young captain recovered his senses in
the cabin of the <i>Bucentaur</i>, the flag-ship of the
French admiral, bound for Europe again, he did not
know whether or not he had won Dorothy Venour.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
III.&#8212;THE REWARD
</p>

<p>
Early in November, a week or so after the great
battle of Trafalgar, which the young captain witnessed
from the deck of the French ship, from which in the
confusion he escaped to the <i>Victory</i>, where he did
good service until the close of the action, he was
landed at Portsmouth once more. In his pocket he
bore two documents, one dated a year and a half
back, and the other but yesterday. Led by an instinct
which he could not explain, instead of going
up to Captain Venour's house on the hill, he made
his way through the town and along the beach toward
that sheltered little cove from which he had taken his
departure two years before. As he turned the point
of rocks he saw a lonesome little figure seated on the
sand, resting her chin in her hand and looking mournfully
out over the sea. It was Dorothy. He stole
up behind her, caught her under the arms, lifted her
to her feet, and kissed her before she could utter a
scream. When she recovered, however, she made up
for her startled silence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim dear!" she cried, precipitating herself
into his arms with a shriek of delight, "you look like
a real man now!"
</p>

<p>
"I am a man, Dot darling," he replied, his eyes
brightening as he saw her radiant face peeping out
from the brown curls near his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," exclaimed the deep voice of Captain
Venour, coming down the beach,&#8212;singular how he
always happened to be around at inopportune moments,&#8212;"you
may be a man, but have you a command?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, grandfather, he has command of me," cried
Dorothy, archly, breaking away from her lover.
"Won't I do?"
</p>

<p>
The old captain whistled.
</p>

<p>
"I've had command of a ship-of-the-line and I've
tried to command one woman, but give me the ship-of-the-line,"
he answered, reflectively. "No, you
won't do."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Venour," remarked the young man,
gravely, "I have had a command, sir, and in accordance
with your agreement I have come to claim
your granddaughter."
</p>

<p>
"What was your command, my lad?" asked the
captain, facetiously, "a dinghy or a jolly-boat?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither, sir."
</p>

<p>
"A cutter, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"A brig or a sloop-of-war?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!" exclaimed the captain; "you
don't mean to say you have been in charge of a
frigate or a ship-of-the-line, a boy like you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, not quite," said the young man.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what did you command? Did it have two
masts?"
</p>

<p>
"It didn't have any masts, sir."
</p>

<p>
"No masts!"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; it was a rock."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" ejaculated the old man, sitting
down feebly and staring. "A rock? What do you
mean? Are you trifling with me? That is no way
to gain the lass."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," answered Maurice, gravely, "here are
my orders authorizing me to command His Majesty's
sloop-of-war <i>Diamond Rock</i>, five guns and one hundred
and twenty men. It's a great stone hill off
Martinique. I commanded it for one year and six
months, at the end of which we beat off M. de Villeneuve's
great fleet, and were only captured when our
powder gave out, by a heavy squadron which bombarded
us for two days. I was wounded&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim, wounded!" cried Dorothy, with a shriek
of alarm, rushing toward him, while the dazed old
man made no movement to prevent her.
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing, Dot darling," said the young fellow,
manfully, but not making the slightest effort to avoid
the caress. "I was wounded and taken on board the
French flag-ship <i>Bucentaur</i>, from which I escaped to
the <i>Victory</i> at Trafalgar, where Nelson beat the French
fleet."
</p>

<p>
"Hey? What?" cried the old man. "Beat the
French? But, of course, we always do that."
</p>

<p>
"I saw him killed, sir," added young Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Who killed?" exclaimed Captain Venour, in
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Lord Nelson, sir; right in the height of the battle."
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" cried Captain Venour. "Nelson
gone? He was a reefer under me on the <i>Hinchinbrook</i>.
It can't be possible!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, it is," replied the young captain.
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause.
</p>

<p>
"What next, sir?" asked Captain Venour.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I swung myself on board the <i>Victory</i>
in the action. Captain Hardy recognized me and
gave me a gun division whose lieutenant had been
killed, and&#8212;and that's all. No, sir; here's a paper
from Lord Collingwood, who succeeded to the command
after Lord Nelson died, recommending me to
be appointed post-captain, and&#8212;and&#8212;that's all, sir.
May I have Dorothy now, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"You may," answered the captain, feebly, utterly
overcome by the astonishing recital. "Any man who
has commanded a six-million-ton rock and fought at
Trafalgar can have anything he wants,&#8212;if Dorothy is
willing."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy signified unmistakably that she was
willing.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Nelson!" continued the old captain. He
rose slowly to his feet and turned away again,
saying,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"I will turn my back once more, young people,
and mind, do it softly!"

<p>
Marian Fletcher was certainly beautiful enough to excuse the jealousy
of any man who loved her,&#8212;which, by the way, most men who knew
her did! She was sufficiently a woman also to realize her own
beauty&#8212;indeed, did ever daughter of Eve possess a charm of which
she lacked knowledge? Even the most absolute <i>ing&#233;nue</i> is
conscious that she is an <i>ing&#233;nue</i>, and Marian Fletcher was
by no means that. And her wit and humor were not the least of her
charms. She was gayety personified, light-hearted, healthy and
red-cheeked, and joyous&#8212;quite a new woman for 1815, in fact; and
that, too, in an artificial age in which languor and pallor, megrims
and vapors were the fashion, "Nice customs curt'sy to"&#8212;beautiful
women, and Marian had a fashion of her own. One word described the sum
of her qualities,&#8212;fascination!
</p>

<p>
Even her best friends were forced to admit that she
was a bit of a coquette, however. Indeed, if the
truth were told, from the crown of her black hair,
which brought to mind the usual simile of the raven's
wing, down to her beautiful little feet, she was all of a
coquette. She loved liberty, she loved love, she loved
lovers. In addition to all of these things it might be
said that, in her secret heart, she loved Robert
Gardner. Whether she loved him more than she did
the other three was a question which she had not
settled to her own satisfaction, and about which Gardner
himself was fearfully undecided.
</p>

<p>
She had said&#8212;but then she made many perjuries
before the laughing Jove. She had permitted him to
enjoy the fleeting and most unsatisfying pleasure of
pressing his lips upon her brow. He believed that
this was a step farther&#8212;he would have resented
furiously any suggestion to the contrary&#8212;than any
other suitor had gone. It was. She had allowed
him to persuade her into a sort of an engagement,
but the tie resulting was about as indefinite as could
be imagined. With him&#8212;he was a sailor and his
similes were nautical&#8212;it was a hempen cable which
held him to her like a ship to a bower anchor. With
her it was a daisy chain, ready to part at the first
strain, and the strain was near at hand.
</p>

<p>
To celebrate the closing of the war of 1812, Colonel
Fletcher, an old Revolutionary veteran and the father
of the fair Marian, had assembled a house-party at his
fine old place on the Hudson. He was a widower with
a son and a daughter. The son had been an officer in
Scott's army&#8212;a major&#8212;who had greatly distinguished
himself in the Niagara campaign. Among others who
had gladly accepted the veteran colonel's hospitality
were two friends of young Major Fletcher, who had
been college-mates with him at Harvard. One was
Robert Gardner, a young lieutenant in the navy, and
the other was John Mason, a young Virginian, who
was a captain in the army. The young men had
been guests of Colonel Fletcher before the war, and
they had known Marian, whom they both loved, for
several years. Their wooing, interrupted by the demands
of the service, was at once renewed under the
favorable circumstances of their meeting. Gardner
was a gay, athletic, dashing young sailor,&#8212;blue-eyed,
curly-haired, sunny in disposition; Mason, on the
contrary, was tall and very slender, dignified and
quiet, with a temper as dark as his complexion. One
was impulsive, bold, impetuous; the other cool and
determined, with an undercurrent of sleeping passion
in his being; both were in the highest sense gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
The relations between the two men, at first friendly,
had become markedly strained as their courtship
proceeded, though no open rupture had yet occurred.
Mason could not but be aware of Marian's preference
for Gardner; yet, as she had not allowed the latter to
announce their engagement, with dogged persistency
the Virginian continued to proffer his attentions.
Truth to say, these latter were not so unwelcome to
the fair Marian as might be imagined. She had
entered into a quasi-engagement with Gardner, yet
she was by no means averse to the devotion of her
melancholy yet handsome suitor, and her conduct between
the two was not altogether above reproach. It
was a joyous and delightful game,&#8212;also a dangerous!
</p>

<p>
On the evening in question it seemed that she
had gone quite too far, and that even the hempen
cable would not stand the strain which tautened it.
During the day a pretty little lover's quarrel, which
she had wilfully brought about to test her power, had
culminated in an open rupture. Laughing at Gardner's
pleas, she had devoted herself to Mason,&#8212;or had
allowed Mason to devote himself to her, rather,&#8212;raising
that young man to the seventh heaven of delight.
She had ridden with him in the afternoon,
gone to supper with him at night, and danced with
him most of the evening at the party which had been
arranged.
</p>

<p>
Man&#339;uvring her out on the porch toward the
close of the evening, Gardner unwisely endeavored to
take her to task. Goaded beyond his power of restraint
by her flirtation, he assumed an authority over
her for which he had no warrant. Where he should
have pleaded and entreated, he threatened and commanded.
Miss Marian snapped her fingers at him
metaphorically&#8212;she was too well bred to do such a
thing physically. Rendered desperate by her obduracy,
his anger passed all bounds and his words
followed suit. The mock quarrel on her part became
a real one. She repudiated him entirely, broke her
engagement flatly, declared frankly that she did not
love him,&#8212;and in the act of declaration she was convinced
that she did,&#8212;and with her head high in the
air, a brilliant flush on her cheek, and a sparkle of
defiance in her eye, left him. He leaped from the
porch and disappeared under the trees; she ran right
into the arms of John Mason coming out of the house
to seek her.
</p>

<p>
He saw her agitation, of course, and in her anger
she let slip words which gave him a perfect clew to
the cause of it. Before she realized what she did, she
said that which she would have given worlds to recall&#8212;afterwards;
then she was too much excited and indignant
to care. Gardner had insulted her. She
hated him.
</p>

<p>
"I hate him, too," said Mason, bending his head,
his black eyes aflame in the shadow of the porch,
"and the depth of my hatred is proportioned by my
love for you, Marian. Give me leave, dearest, to
make your cause mine."
</p>

<p>
His voice with its soft Southern tones was very persuasive
and thrilling in the moonlight; there was such
passion and yet such respect and adoration in its
accents. He bent before her so deferentially and so
pleadingly. There was such a contrast in his gentleness
to the hectoring she had just undergone, that she
yielded in spite of herself. With bent head she murmured
words&#8212;she hardly knew what. Faintly resisting
him, he swept her to his breast and pressed a
kiss, not upon her forehead, but upon her lips.
</p>

<p>
At the instant a step on the porch interrupted
them. Marian, already repentant, sprang from
Mason's encircling arms and turned to see Gardner
coming toward them. He had wandered about the
grounds miserably after they had parted and had
returned to sue for pardon, but what he had just seen
had changed his mind. His face was convulsed with
passion. Disregarding Marian, he stepped toward
Mason, his hand upraised as if he would strike him
down. There was murder in his heart. The girl
screamed and then turned and fled in dismay.
She had broken her engagement with a man whom
she now realized she loved with all her heart, and she
had promised herself to a man whom she knew she
did not love. She had been bitterly unjust, in her
folly, to both men.
</p>

<p>
The dancing for the evening was already over. The
women of the party were retiring to their rooms, and
Marian, sick at heart, slipped away and sought her
chamber also. Throwing herself dressed upon her
bed, she thought it over. Nothing would happen
until the morning, she reasoned, and then she would
make a clean breast of it to her father. He would
extricate her from her difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Mason on the porch was already master of himself.
</p>

<p>
"Don't strike me!" he said to Gardner, "or I shall
kill you where you stand! Besides, 'tis not necessary.
I understand your feelings and I intend to
give you satisfaction, but the cause of our quarrel
must not be known. The reputation of the woman&#8212;I
intend to make my wife must not be the subject
of public comment. Control yourself, sir, I beg of
you," he added, smiling triumphantly, as the other
stamped his foot. "Let us repair to the house. The
ladies will have retired, and we can easily manufacture
sufficient public cause for a quarrel. I will take it
upon myself. Come no nearer!" he said, thrusting
his hand into the pocket of his coat as Gardner
swayed toward him. "I warn you that I am armed.
On my word, I will shoot you like a mad dog! I
will submit to nothing from you. I am giving you a
chance for your life and affording you every satisfaction
as it is."
</p>

<p>
Gardner controlled himself with a mighty effort.
</p>

<p>
"You are right," he gasped; "'tis not through fear
that I do not strike you, but, as you say, Miss Fletcher's
name must not become the subject of gossip. You
shall never marry her! I intend to kill you!"
</p>

<p>
"That's as may be," answered the other; "let us
not come to blows about it. I am not used to such.
'Tis vulgar brawling. Control yourself. I take your
arm, so. Though 'tis hateful to both of us, we must
appear to be on friendly terms."
</p>

<p>
Arm in arm the two rivals entered the hall and no
one dreamed of the deadly hatred which sundered
them. After the departure of the women Colonel
Fletcher and his guests sat down to spend the rest of
the evening&#8212;morning rather&#8212;between cards and the
bottle. Chance, or their own contrivance, made
Mason and Gardner partners. Neither of the two
partook of the wine. As the heat of Gardner's
passion abated, he realized the necessity for acquiring
his wonted calmness. He was a famous shot with the
pistol, a weapon with which Mason was not so
familiar, and he believed that if he had an opportunity
he could kill him. He fully intended to do so.
</p>

<p>
It was an age in which duels were common and life
was cheap. Mason was to afford the provocation and
give the challenge. He said he would do so and he
was a man of his word. Then, as the challenged
party, Gardner would have the choice of weapons.
As the game proceeded, Mason, who had made several
irritating remarks upon his partner's playing,
finally remarked, sneeringly:
</p>

<p>
"That's a cowardly deal, Gardner. Why don't
you play more boldly, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Cowardly!" cried Gardner, rising.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I said. But then what could you
expect from a man who had been an officer on the
<i>Chesapeake</i>?"
</p>

<p>
The allusion, of course, was to the capture of the
American frigate <i>Chesapeake</i> by the British frigate
<i>Shannon</i>, which was almost the solitary instance of
English naval success in the war, but for which
Gardner was in no way responsible.
</p>

<p>
"By gad, sir!" shouted Gardner, "if I play like a
coward, you play like a booby! Your tactics are
what one would naturally expect from a soldier whose
chief exploit was in leading the flying troops from
Bladensburg!" another American defeat and a disgraceful
one at that, although Mason had there fought
bravely until wounded.
</p>

<p>
"You shall wipe out this insult, sir!" responded
Mason, rising in his turn.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the other, "in the only possible way."
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" interrupted some of
the others.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" exclaimed the colonel, leaving his
table and approaching them. "Brawling in my
house among my guests? I will have none of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," cried Gardner, "you are a soldier. You are
all soldiers here; I alone am a sailor. This person
called me a coward, taunted me with the loss of the
<i>Chesapeake</i>. By heavens, he shall apologize!"
</p>

<p>
"What?" said the colonel. "Did you make use
of such intemperate language, Captain Mason?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, sir," responded the other, coolly, "and I
may add that he accused me of leading the retreat at
Bladensburg, which is a damnable lie, sir! I challenge
him instantly!"
</p>

<p>
"He but anticipates my own desire," said Gardner.
"You see, sir, the matter must be arranged. As the
challenged party I name pistols, and if the time is
agreeable I appoint this moment for the encounter.
Major Fletcher will perhaps honor me by acting as
my second."
</p>

<p>
"And Captain Lee," said Mason, turning to one of
the others, "will, I am sure, act for me."
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said the colonel, retiring with the
seconds, "cannot this unhappy affair be arranged?"
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible, sir," replied Lee and his son,
who had consulted a moment or two with their respective
principals.
</p>

<p>
"There must be more behind this than appears."
</p>

<p>
"That's as may be, colonel; there is enough on
the surface, anyway; the two men have deliberately
insulted each other, and the duel must go on," replied
Captain Lee.
</p>

<p>
"I entirely agree with Lee, father," assented Major
Fletcher.
</p>

<p>
The preliminaries were soon arranged. The party
had assembled in the dining-room. The long table
was pushed to one side of the room. The colonel's
duelling pistols had been loaded under the supervision
of the seconds and each contestant had received his
weapon. At one side of the apartment the men of
the party were gathered; one of them held a lighted
candelabrum high in the air to light both men equally.
All other lights in the room had been extinguished.
Pistol in hand at the table stood Colonel Fletcher.
Six paces were measured in the centre of the room by
the seconds, and marked off by two playing-cards laid
on the floor. Mason and Gardner were placed opposite
each other, each one with his right foot touching the
card marking his station. It had been agreed between
the seconds that the colonel should pronounce the
words "one, two," and then "fire!" and that after the
word "fire!" the combatants should fire at pleasure.
</p>

<p>
As is often the case, in the moment of danger
Gardner's coolness came back to him. He believed
that Marian had permitted herself to be inveigled
into an engagement to Mason because of the quarrel
and his behavior toward her. He felt confident that
she loved him, and he intended to solve the dilemma
in which she had placed herself by killing the other
man. No feeling of pity, no intention to spare his
rival, found even a momentary lodgment in his heart.
As he stood thinking hard while the arrangements
were being completed, he marked the very spot
where the lace of Mason's coat crossed his heart, into
which he intended to send his bullet. The soldier
wore his usual uniform, and the frock coat loosely
buttoned about his spare form gave him a stouter appearance
than his proportions warranted.
</p>

<p>
It was Gardner's purpose to fire instantly upon the
giving of the word, trusting to his quickness of movement
and his accuracy of aim to kill his opponent
before he had time to pull the trigger. As he looked
at Mason standing so cool and so quiet before him, he
felt that he would have need of all his skill and
address to win the game, in which not only love, but
life, were the stakes.
</p>

<p>
On Mason's part, while his desire to kill his opponent
was as great as Gardner's, his tactics were
different. Though ordinarily familiar with his weapon
and able to give a good account of himself if he had
his own time for firing, he knew that he would be at
a tremendous disadvantage in a quick exchange of
shots. He realized also that with his usual impetuosity
Gardner would fire instantly the word was given.
He determined, therefore, to submit to the fearful risk
of receiving the hasty shot which he felt would come,
and if he were then unharmed, deliberately take his
time in returning it. He had no suspicion but that
the acceptance of his suit had been genuine, and he
longed to live with a double intensity on account of
the depth of his passion.
</p>

<p>
All preparations having been made, the colonel
took his place. The seconds removed a little distance
away from their principals to be out of range.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready, gentlemen?" said the colonel.
</p>

<p>
"Ready, sir!" answered both men, promptly.
</p>

<p>
They both stood slightly turned, their right sides
presented, their arms depending, with the cocked
pistol in the right hand.
</p>

<p>
"You know the conditions. I shall count 'one,
two,' and then give the word 'fire!'" continued the
colonel. "After the order is given you may discharge
your weapons at will."
</p>

<p>
The colonel had a third pistol in hand, for what
purpose no one quite understood. The silence was
absolutely breathless.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a  name="one"><img src="images/008.jpg" alt="&quot;One!&quot; said the old soldier, his voice ringing hollow through the apartment" width="500" height="290"></a></div>
<p class="caption">"One!" said the old soldier, his voice ringing hollow through the apartment
</p>

<p>
"One!" said the old soldier, his voice ringing
hollow through the apartment.
</p>

<p>
"Two!" he said, more strongly.
</p>

<p>
"Fire!" he snapped out at last.
</p>

<p>
Instantly there was a flash of light, a cloud of
smoke, a crashing report from Gardner's pistol.
Mason's second, closely watching his principal,
thought he saw a flick of dust rise from his coat.
The Virginian staggered slightly, raised his left arm
and laid it across his breast, but still stood erect, his
pistol in his half-extended hand.
</p>

<p>
"Great God!" cried Gardner, hoarsely, as he saw
his rival standing before him apparently unharmed.
"Have I missed him?"
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in bewilderment to his head and
staggered back from his position.
</p>

<p>
"Back to the card, sir!" thundered the colonel,
cocking and raising his pistol and pointing it directly
at Gardner.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, sir," returned the sailor, dauntlessly,
stepping back to the card as he spoke. "I trust no
gentleman here will think I shrank from the return
bullet. 'Twas but surprise. Take your shot, I beg
of you, Captain Mason."
</p>

<p>
His face was deadly pale, yet he forced a smile to
his lips.
</p>

<p>
"You still have a shot, Captain Mason. Take it.
We acquit Lieutenant Gardner of any timidity whatever,"
said the colonel, lowering his weapon.
</p>

<p>
Mason, who had grown as white as his rival, deliberately
raised his pistol and took long and careful
aim. The men in the room gazed breathlessly. They
shifted about uneasily. Gardner stood with the smile
petrified upon his face. Mason at last pressed the
trigger, but the pistol missed fire and there was no
discharge. The soldier lowered his arm and recocked
his weapon.
</p>

<p>
"By heavens, it looks like murder!" burst forth
one of the men.
</p>

<p>
"Silence, gentlemen!" shouted the colonel, handling
his pistol again; "the man is entitled to his shot, and
he shall have it. I'll kill the first man that interferes!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg him to take it," cried Gardner, with splendid
courage, for if ever man could read his death-warrant
in another's face, he saw it in the countenance of his
antagonist.
</p>

<p>
Once more Mason raised his pistol. This time
nothing prevented the discharge. His deliberate aim
had been successful, and Gardner fell dead instantly,
the bullet in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Mason, with the smoking pistol clenched in his
hand, and with his left arm still pressed against his
heart, walked over to the table and stood by it, leaning
heavily upon it as he stared at the little group
bending over his dead rival. At that moment the
door was flung open and Marian, dressed as she had
been at the dance, but with tear-stained face, frightened
looks, and dishevelled hair, burst into the room.
She happened to face Mason, and, her back being
turned to the other end of the room, she did not see
the body of Gardner.
</p>

<p>
"I heard shots," she cried; "have they&#8212;where is
he?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel and gentlemen," said Mason, faintly,
coming forward with that left hand still pressed against
his breast, "'tis an unseemly moment to announce it,
but Miss Fletcher has honored me with a promise of
herself to me to-night. We are&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
The girl turned to him with a look of abject horror
and repulsion. She screamed faintly. The man
was half blind apparently; he did not seem to realize.
</p>

<p>
"Have no fear for me, Marian dear," he went on,
softly, "I am&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"What have you done?" she shrieked. "Where is
Robert Gardner? 'Tis he I love, not you!"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes instinctively followed the glances of those
about her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried. "What is that? Robert! Oh,
my God, and I have killed you!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice rang through the room in such an awful
note of agony that every man's heart stood still. The
colonel moved toward her, but her living lover was
quicker. He caught her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Don't touch me!" she cried, shrinking away from
him. "There is blood on your hand! His blood!
You are a murderer!"
</p>

<p>
Her bitter words recalled him in a measure to himself.
</p>

<p>
"No, madam," he answered, smiling faintly, "'Tis
my own."
</p>

<p>
He tore open his coat, showing the bosom of his
shirt and waistcoat stained with blood. He had been
hit, but the loose coat had deceived his opponent's
aim, and the bullet had missed the heart. He had so
controlled himself that no one suspected that he was
wounded, and he had almost bled to death in the
effort.
</p>

<p>
The woman, the roses all shuddered out of her
cheeks, a ghastly picture, stared from the dead to the
living with dazed, terrified glances.
</p>

<p>
"You," continued Mason, swaying as he spoke,&#8212;"you
have trifled with two honest men, and from your
cursed coquetry one lies dead yonder and one&#8212;and
one&#8212;dies&#8212;at your feet!"
</p>

<p>
He suddenly collapsed before her, caught feebly at
her white satin skirt with his bloody hands as he lay
upon the floor and strove to carry it to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"He loved you," he murmured, "and I, too&#8212;we
were fools&#8212;for a woman."
</p>

<p>
That was all.

I.&#8212;IN FORT PATRICK HENRY
</p>

<p>
The Indians were out again!
</p>

<p>
The sharp rattling of a drum frantically
beaten rolled through the little
hamlet. The silent, pine-clad hills rising
above the clearing on the bank
sent the echoes clattering back over the river.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had the peacefulness of the evening been
broken by the first note of the clamor when from
every door of hut or cabin the excited people poured
out into the clearing and ran toward the stockade.
</p>

<p>
First came half-grown boys and girls, yelling half
in terror, half in sport; then frightened mothers clasping
crying babies to their troubled breasts with one
hand, and with the other dragging stumbling little
children. Then the men of the settlement, coatless,
hatless, clad as they were in the various occupations
in which they had been engaged at the moment,
brought up the rear.
</p>

<p>
Some of the men endeavored to drive a few bewildered
cattle; others helped to bring the younger
children; but, whatever his action, each one carried
a long, deadly rifle, as with grim, set faces they hurried
toward the open gate of the fort on the shore.
A panting horse stood by the gate, his drooping head
giving evidence of the exhaustion following a desperate
ride.
</p>

<p>
Inside the fort a young man, dressed in the usual
fringed hunting-shirt and leggings, eternal garment
of the Western pioneer, leaned upon his tall rifle and
with eager gestures poured out the details of that
message which had started the rolling of the drum.
</p>

<p>
The Indians were out,&#8212;the fierce Wyandotte, the
bloody Mingo, the ruthless Shawnee. A huge war-party
accompanying a band of British rangers from
Detroit had been discovered in the woods early that
September morning in 1777. They were marching
toward Fort Patrick Henry on the banks of the Ohio,
a rude white-oak stockade some sixteen feet high,
extending along the river where now the mighty furnaces
of Wheeling toss smoke and flame high into
the air.
</p>

<p>
The Indians were yet some distance away; but the
messenger, young Hugh McCullough, the bravest,
most daring, most gallant young man among the
thirty families clustered about the fort, and the one
surest to hit his mark with the rifle, could not tell
how soon they might be there. But they might
appear at any moment; and Colonel Sheppard, the
commander, deemed it best to bring all of the settlement people into the fort at once. Hence the sudden
alarm and call to arms.
</p>

<p>
Presently the little enclosure was filled with crying
children, boastful boys, frightened girls, serious
women, and thoughtful men. The gates were shut;
the younger children, under the care of the older
women, sent to the safest room in the four corner
block-houses, while the matrons set about preparing
food, moulding bullets, making cartridges, and lending
to the contemplated defence such other assistance
as they could. The men and youths fell in with their
respective companies and repaired immediately to
their several stations, long practice and frequent
alarms having made them familiar with the duties expected
of them.
</p>

<p>
A long time they watched that evening, but no
plumed, painted, savage figure could be seen through
the trees, no sound broke the wonted stillness of the
hills. Some of the little band of frontiersmen looked
askance at young McCullough. Had he given a false
alarm? himself deceived, taken them from their needed
labors only to array them against some imaginary
peril?
</p>

<p>
But no; he was the keenest scout and best woods-man
in the settlement. A long row of sinister
notches on the stock of his rifle marked the red
marauders he had sent to their last account. It
could not be; yet, if the Indians were coming, why
did they not present themselves?
</p>

<p>
Old Colonel Sheppard and Major Ebenezer Zane,
his second, did not hesitate; they trusted the young
man. Requests to return to their homes were refused,
the gates were kept closed, and by and by the women
and children who could do so disposed themselves
for the troubled sleep of an anxious night. There
were keen watchers on the walls, but nothing broke
the usual stillness.
</p>

<p>
The morning was dull and gray. Clouds of mist
and fog dropped silently from the crest of the hills,
sending down long, ghostlike arms writhing through
the treetops over the town; still no sign of the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
Smarting under the curious glances and sneers of
some of the men, McCullough at last volunteered to
go out and reconnoitre. Colonel Sheppard accepted
his offer. While some one saddled his magnificent
black horse, he broke from the group surrounding
him and walked across the parade toward the farthest
block-house, a room in which had been allotted to the
family of Major Zane.
</p>

<p>
A tall, striking-looking young woman stood in the
door-way. Most of the women in the fort wore linsey-woolsey
frocks of the plainest cut, and, while some
had Indian moccasins on their feet, the majority were
barefoot. This girl was dressed in the fashion of,
say, some six months before. There was a touch of
brightness and color in her smart frock, albeit a few
months of frontier wear had sadly dimmed its gayety.
Shining silver buckles overspread her small, daintily
shod, arched instep. Her short sleeves, extending
only to the elbow, left bare her young brown arms,
which had been white when she came to the settlement. The kerchief, crossed over her breast, but
open at the neck, afforded a ravishing glimpse of her
beautiful throat. Under her fair hair blue eyes
sparkled, lighting, in spite of herself, with feeling as
she comprehended the manly figure of young McCullough.
</p>

<p>
He was fluent enough in speech ordinarily; but
now he blushed, hesitated, and stumbled awkwardly,
as he dragged off his coonskin cap and bowed low
before her.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mistress Elizabeth," he at length
managed to stammer out; "how passed you the
night?"
</p>

<p>
"As well, sir, as one could on a hard floor 'twixt
crying children, frightened mothers, and quarrelling
lads."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis not like Philadelphia, mistress?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed. To think that six months gone I
was there, a girl in school, and now&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are a teacher yourself, Mistress Zane,
and we be all learning from you."
</p>

<p>
"Learning what, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"The game of hearts."
</p>

<p>
"Faith, Master McCullough, if rumor belie you
not, I think you must have been a past master at that
game before I came upon the scene."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, not so. Dame Rumor does me wrong,
but&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, let it pass, Master McCullough. You
brought the alarm, I believe. Was it real? Are
there any Indians about?"
</p>

<p>
"We have not seen any as yet in the valley,
but&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"And was it you, sir, who tramped all night on
the block-house over our heads?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, indeed, watch over&#8212;you, but&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Could you not have done it more softly, sir, and
not add to the confusion the clatter of your feet and
the thud of your gunstock? I knew it was you."
</p>

<p>
"Knew you my step, Mistress Elizabeth?" he
queried eagerly, flushing with hope.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, sir," she answered, coolly; "none other had
been so foolish; but the Indians?"
</p>

<p>
"I go to seek them now and would fain say good-by."
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried the girl, breathlessly, dropping her
mood of airy banter, her face gone white in a moment.
"What! you leave the stockade?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Mistress Elizabeth, and I am come to beg
you&#8212;to wish you&#8212;to bid me good-speed."
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going and why?"
</p>

<p>
"Up the valley to beat up the red devils; to find
them if they be not gone."
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, you will be in danger!" cried the girl,
piteously, stepping from the door-way and coming
nearer to him.
</p>

<p>
"I am in more danger from your bright eyes than
from any Indian that walks."
</p>

<p>
"A truce to this trifling, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, 'tis no trifling. My heart's gone to you.
You have known it long since. Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
She stopped with downcast head before him.
</p>

<p>
"They&#8212;they did not teach us things&#8212;like that&#8212;in
Philadelphia."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, 'twas Mother Eve taught you, I'm thinking;
and, as I may be&#8212;" he hesitated, and then continued
softly, "a long time in coming back, I thought I must
tell you now or you might never hear it. I love
you." He turned away. "That's all."
</p>

<p>
She sprang toward him and grasped him by the
arm.
</p>

<p>
"Go not," she whispered, her eyes brimming.
"Stay." Her head sank forward; she trembled as
if she would fall. Unmindful of all others, he slipped
his arm around her waist. "Stay," she continued so
softly that he could scarce hear her words, though he
bent his head eagerly to catch them. "Stay&#8212;for
me."
</p>

<p>
"Then you love, too, thank God!" he cried.
"Nay, I must go; but I go for you."
</p>


<p class="subhead">
II.&#8212;THE MAN'S DARING
</p>

<p>
His horse was ready at the gate now. The place
was filled with men; yet, reckless of all who might
note, he bent his head low and kissed her unresisting.
Then he tore himself away and sprang to the saddle.
With a wave of his hand toward the assemblage, a
long glance at the girl who stood with clasped hands
and white, upturned face staring after him, he struck
spur to his horse and dashed out through the gate.
They followed him with their gaze for a short distance
up the road until he was lost in the trees which
covered its winding course.
</p>

<p>
And so the morning wore on. About noon the
watchers saw three or four Indians in the trees. The
little band halted out of rifle range on the edge of
the clearing, and scanned the deserted settlement and
the fort with its starry banner drooping idly from its
staff. The mist was heavier now; it was almost a
fog.
</p>

<p>
Two men were ordered to go out the postern gate
under cover of the river bank, creep along the shore
until they gained the trees, and then endeavor to discover
whether or not there were more Indians there.
A little party of twelve, under Captain Mason, was
assembled near the gate, ready to dash out and attack
the Indians in sight if it were deemed advisable. It
often happened that such a swift, sharp blow diverted
a more serious attack.
</p>

<p>
Nothing had as yet been heard of McCullough.
Elizabeth Zane had passed a morning of agonized
apprehension. She was a motherless girl, who lived
with her brother, the major; but she had spent most
of her life in quiet Quaker Philadelphia at school.
Only recently had she come to the frontier; this was
her first experience in war&#8212;or love.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the silence was broken by the sharp
crack of a rifle. One of the Indians was seen to fall.
The scouts had evidently attacked them. The fire
was returned by the group of savages. There was a
sharp fusillade in the woodland. Captain Mason and
his comrades tore out of the fort and ran toward the
sound of the firing. A wave of mist rolled down and
shut them in.
</p>

<p>
The eager watchers on the walls could hear the
rattle of the rifles and see the dark shadows cast by
the forest shot with flashes of fire. The engagement
seemed to be getting heavier. What was happening?
They were not able to tell. The fog completely hid
from their view the ravine in which the firing was
going on.
</p>

<p>
Presently a man broke out of the mist and ran
toward the fort. He was hatless; his gun was gone.
He was bleeding from several wounds. His face was
ghastly pale.
</p>

<p>
"Help!" he cried, brokenly. "The Indians are
on us, hundreds of 'em!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he pitched forward and fell dead on
his face just outside the gate. The fort was filled
with excitement. The wife of the man who had just
fallen shrieked with anguish, while the other women
strove to comfort her and to hush the whimpering of
the children.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Sheppard turned to another officer.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Ogle," he said, quickly, "take your
company of twelve men, deploy them to the edge of
the woods, and try to cover the retreat or bring off
Mason and his men. Be careful, and do not be ambushed.
We are but eleven men left here after you
go to defend this post and one hundred women and
children."
</p>

<p>
Again the gates were opened and a little band of
determined hunters stole noiselessly toward the clearing.
The rifle shots had ceased by this time, but they
had been superseded by fierce Indian yells and a
chorus of shrieks and cries from struggling men.
Ogle's company stole rapidly forward, but before
they could reach the place of conflict they were met
by a fire which seemed to come from every direction.
Out of the fog and smoke appeared the Indians,
tomahawk in hand.
</p>

<p>
There was a fierce, wild <i>m&#234;l&#233;e</i> for a moment, and
then silence. A sudden breeze blew down the valley,
lifting the fog; and the dismayed garrison saw the
ground strewn with the bodies of their friends and
neighbors, while just out of range the Indians danced,
yelling frantically, jumping high into the air, and
flourishing gory scalps, which they had wrenched
from the heads of the fallen while some of them were
yet alive. Four or five desperately wounded men
gained the fort under a rattling rifle fire.
</p>

<p>
As the day cleared the Indians sought cover in the
deserted houses on the edge of the woods and opened
fire on the stockade. A perfect storm of bullets was
hurled upon the fort; but the defenders, well protected,
suffered no loss, and, firing slowly and deliberately
in return, strove to make every shot tell
and with good effect. The Indians could not expose
themselves for a moment without being hit.
</p>

<p>
Presently down the mountain came a party of
rangers under the British flag, militia from Canada.
With drums beating and fifes squealing they marched
up the road, dragging a small cannon, with which they
opened an ineffectual fire upon the fort. After a
while, however, wearying of this fruitless duel, the
assailants withdrew out of range and the roar of the
battle died away, although the investment of the place
was still vigorously maintained.
</p>

<p>
About four o'clock a burst of yells and shouts
attracted the attention of the garrison to the top of
the hill overlooking the fort. A single horseman
suddenly appeared on the brink above the clearing,
his tall figure plainly silhouetted against the sky-line.
The hill where he overlooked it was some three hundred
feet high and almost perpendicular, although the
rough slope was broken here and there by drifts and
ledges. He reined in his horse abruptly on the very
brink and gazed backward.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Zane stood by her brother on the roof
of one of the block-houses. With eyes lighted by
affection, she knew McCullough instantly. Presently
others recognized him also. They could hear the yelling
drawing nearer. They saw McCullough look to the
right and the left and shake his head; they saw him
turn and discharge his rifle at his unseen pursuers.
</p>

<p>
They realized the situation at once. There was a
lost man on the brink of that hill, his gun discharged,
weaponless, surrounded by Indians, who were closing
in upon him to take him alive and torture him. Death
at the stake! There was no salvation for him!
</p>

<p>
What could he do? Would he dismount and face
them? Would he try to ride over them? A moment
would tell. Elizabeth closed her eyes, and her anguished
lips strove in vain to form the words of a prayer.
</p>

<p>
"He is going to try the hill!" cried Major Zane,
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The bold hunter shortened the bridle, backed his
horse away from the hill a few feet, and then launched
him into the air. The cry of defiance that he gave
as he dropped down the steep slope could have been
heard for miles around. Scarcely had he vanished
from the crest of the hill when the faces of the Indians
appeared over it. The edge of the bluff was
instantly ringed with fire.
</p>

<p>
"He falls!" cried one from the fort.
</p>

<p>
"He is down!" screamed another.
</p>

<p>
"No, he makes it!"
</p>

<p>
"They've hit him!"
</p>

<p>
"He's reached the ground safe!"
</p>

<p>
"They've got him!"
</p>

<p>
"No, he's up again!"
</p>

<p>
"He's coming here!"
</p>

<p>
"To the gate! to the gate!"
</p>

<p>
The bold hunter had actually leaped, scrambled,
fallen down that mighty precipice; and horse and
man apparently were both unharmed at the bottom.
It was a feat of daring horsemanship which has been
the pride of the vicinity ever since.
</p>

<p>
Between him and the fort, however, lay the Indians.
Startled and surprised by the hardihood and success of
the descent, they stood dazed for a moment. Grasping
his rifle by the barrel, with the butt up, McCullough
swept down upon them. The first man who laid hand
upon the bridle he brained with the rifle-butt. Dropping
the rein, he cut at the next with his hunting-knife.
The excited horse struck out savagely and beat out the
brains of a third. The rest gave back for a moment.
He was through!
</p>

<p>
In another second, bending low over the saddle, he
was galloping madly toward the fort. Again the rifles
cracked around him. They saw him falter in the
saddle, sway uneasily. At the same time his horse
gave a great bound forward. They had both been hit,
then.
</p>

<p>
The Indians in their excitement ran after him, forgetting
they were within range until the riflemen on
the walls sent bullet after bullet straight to the mark.
The brave horse staggered and fell outside the gate,
pitching the man heavily on his head.
</p>

<p>
Under cover of the rifle fire, two men ran out of the
open gate, and one woman, Elizabeth Zane, followed
after. They picked up McCullough and brought him
within the stockade and laid him on the ground.
The young girl, white-faced, despairing, dropped by
his side and took his head in her arms. Her kisses
and piteous pleadings seemed to revive him, and a
draught of spirits restored him.
</p>

<p>
"Safe, safe, Elizabeth!" he murmured. "Keep up
a good heart, all," he added as soon as he could
speak clearly. "Colonel Sheppard, I found the Indians
out there."
</p>

<p>
"I see you did, my boy," said the colonel, smiling
grimly. "What then?"
</p>

<p>
"I rode off to Colonel Swearingen and told him you
were beleaguered, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and what did he say?"
</p>

<p>
"He'll raise a force and be with you in the morning.
Where are the rest of the men?" he cried,
looking around at the little handful of people. "Why
are the women using the rifles?" he went on, noticing
that the weakness of the garrison had compelled some
of the women to take the places of the dead soldiers.
"I'm needed here, I see. I am not hurt," he continued;
"let me up!"
</p>

<p>
"But you are wounded!" cried Elizabeth. "You
cannot."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, 'tis nothing," he exclaimed; "a flesh
wound in the arm and a graze along the chest. When
the horse fell he threw me so heavily that it stunned
me. When my arm is bound up I'll be all right."
</p>

<p>
"Water here," called the colonel, "and some
linen!"
</p>

<p>
"We have none in the fort, sir," answered Major
Zane.
</p>

<p>
"A woman's petticoat, then."
</p>

<p>
"Take mine," cried Elizabeth, rising and lifting her
outside skirt and tearing a strip off her underskirt.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, not your city finery, Mistress Elizabeth,"
protested McCullough, sitting up as well.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is too fine for a brave man, sir," she
answered, smiling proudly down at him.
</p>

<p>
"Not even Elizabeth Zane?" he questioned, cunningly.
</p>

<p>
"Not even Elizabeth Zane," she replied, bravely, in
spite of her blushes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" he whispered, as she bent down
and bound up the wound.
</p>

<p>
"Zane," said the colonel, laughing at the oblivious
pair, "did you ever know a peril so deadly that it
could prevent two young people from making love?"
</p>

<p>
The wound, from which he had lost much blood,
would have incapacitated a modern man from further
fighting; but that little handful could not afford to
lose a single member if they hoped to stand off the
three hundred savages around the fort, so McCullough
took his place on the walls with the rest. For some
little time the interchange of fire was kept up, with
further loss on the part of the Indians, but none at all
to the Americans; but it was evident that some plan
was being matured. The rangers were seen man&#339;uvring
through the trees; the cannon was dragged to
a point where it could do greater execution.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Colonel Sheppard and Major Zane, with
McCullough to second their efforts, were looking carefully
to their defences. Every rifle, musket, and
ancient pistol was brought out, charged, and laid at
hand, ready for use. At this moment, however, a
startling discovery was made: the powder had all but
given out! Without powder they would be helpless
to resist the assault which would apparently be delivered
in a short time.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
III.&#8212;THE WOMAN'S HEROISM
</p>

<p>
As the news spread among the men and the women,
a panic filled their hearts. Was that crowded enclosure,
filled with women and children, to be delivered
to the ruthless passions of those ferocious
Indians and the half-breed rangers? God forbid!
Yet what was to be done?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that we had some powder! I'd give my life
for a keg of it!" exclaimed Colonel Sheppard, in despair.
"Has every recess been searched?"
</p>

<p>
"We ransacked the fort, sir; there is none here,"
was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"I know where there is some," suddenly cried
Major Zane. "In my cabin yonder there is a small
keg of it; enough for us all. I had forgotten it until
this moment. I'll go and get it."
</p>

<p>
The cabin was some sixty yards from the gate, and
within easy rifle range of the busy enemy.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis sure death to venture there," cried the
colonel; "besides, you are next in charge here. I
cannot let you go."
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!" cried McCullough.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, you've done enough, and with your wounded
arm you could not carry it. Besides, we need you."
</p>

<p>
"Let me!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," cried one and another, as the old colonel
looked about him in an agony of indecision.
</p>

<p>
"We need you all; I can't spare a man," he muttered,
hoarsely. "I don't see how we can hold the
walls against another assault, as it is, with but a dozen
able men here. Was ever man in such a position?"
</p>

<p>
"I will go, colonel," cried a clear voice from the
women about the group of men.
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth!" exclaimed her brother.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Zane!" interrupted McCullough; "nay,
you shall not. 'Tis no woman's work! I&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, sir!" interrupted the colonel. "Who
commands this garrison? 'Tis not woman's work,
indeed; but we can spare no men. I cannot risk a
single rifle. The maid shall go, and God bless her!
If she falls, why, she but anticipates the fate of the
rest of us."
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth! Elizabeth!" cried McCullough, appealingly,
still unconvinced; "you can't go! Think
what your life is to me!"
</p>

<p>
"No more than yours is to me, Master Hugh," she
answered, bravely, "and yet you went."
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth, sister," cried Zane, "I can't let you
go! You must not take this fearful risk!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, gentlemen," interrupted Elizabeth, stoutly,
"I will go! Open the gate. Do you cover me with
your rifles as best you can. Good-by."
</p>

<p>
"Stay!" cried McCullough, grasping her by the
arm. "Gentlemen, I love her and she loves me.
Would you send away my promised wife? Must
I see her killed before my eyes? Oh, let me try?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, you shall not!" said the girl, kissing him
and suddenly thrusting him from her, crying, "Forgive
me!"
</p>

<p>
There was a flash of skirts through the open gate,
and she was gone. Forgetful of his wounds, McCullough
sprang to the top of the block-house nearest
the gate. His own rifle in hand, and sweeping one or
two others within reach, in spite of the pain from
his injured arm, he knelt on the roof, peering eagerly
down the hill.
</p>

<p>
As she left the block-house Elizabeth ran with the
speed of a deer straight to her brother's house. She
knew exactly where the powder lay concealed. She
felt little fear in the advance. Seeing a woman running toward them, and ignorant of her purpose, the
Indians probably would not attempt to harm her; but
when she started back with the heavy keg of powder
in her arms they would detect the reason for her
movement and open fire upon her at once. Her
comparatively slow progress under her burden would
make her position exceedingly dangerous then. But
that was a chance she realized she would have to
take.
</p>

<p>
It happened just as she had anticipated. She
gained the house without molestation and disappeared
within the door-way for a moment, though it seemed
hours to the men and women who watched from the
fort until she appeared with the keg of powder on
her shoulder. One glance she cast back toward the
Indians standing gazing in startled surprise; one long
look she threw toward the fort where, although she
could not detect him in her excitement, she knew her
lover was on guard, and then she started up the hill.
</p>

<p>
As she came out from the cover of the house the
Indians saw the keg of powder upon her shoulder and
at once realized what she was attempting to do.
With roars of rage they opened fire. The bullets
whistled and sang about her ears; they spattered the
earth about her flying feet; one grazed her neck;
another tipped her arm; a third glanced off the iron
hoop of the keg she carried. If one struck the powder
fairly, she would probably be blown to atoms. A
new peril!
</p>

<p>
Her breath came quickly, her heart rose in her
throat and seemed to choke her, mists swam before
her eyes as she ran up the hill. Blindly she struggled
on. She swayed to and fro over the rough
ploughed ground, and the watchers thought she
would have fallen or dropped her burden, but something
superhuman in her enabled her to hold tight
and press on.
</p>

<p>
She could not tell whether she ran rapidly or not;
but her progress seemed slow, fearfully slow. Presently
the firing stopped. Three of the Indians, tomahawk
in hand, broke from the trees and recklessly
started up the hill after her. They would try to
capture her. Heedless of a possible rifle fire from the
fort as they came within range, they leaped on her trail.
</p>

<p>
That was McCullough's opportunity. With a
prayer in his heart that God might speed the bullet,
he took careful aim. The first half-naked painted
demon was nearing the girl with every bound. Two
more steps and she would be in his grasp. She
heard his feet on the ground; his yell rang in her ear.
In spite of herself she started aside and looked around.
</p>

<p>
McCullough had his opening at last. A rifle shot
rang out. She heard the scream of the bullet past
her head. The savage threw up his hands, groaned
horribly, and pitched forward with a bullet in his
breast. Encouraged, she ran a few steps farther.
Her foot caught in a forked piece of timber. The
other pursuing Indians were near her now. The
wood was filled with the enemy holding their fire and
watching the mad chase.
</p>

<p>
"Let no one else fire," called McCullough. "You
might hit her. Leave them to me."
</p>

<p>
These two savages, warned by the fate of the first,
were wise enough to keep directly behind the fleeing
girl. But, as her foot caught, she plunged sideways
to extricate herself, leaving the shoe with its glittering
silver buckle in the obstruction. That one second was
enough for McCullough again. Once more the unerring
rifle cracked and the second Indian fell.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, recovering her wits, ran sideways now.
The third Indian, attracted by the shining buckle,
stooped for a moment to pick it up. McCullough
fired a third rifle, which some one put into his hand.
The bullet shattered the Indian's arm. With a cry of
pain and rage, his other hand dropped down toward
the lost slipper, and this time a bullet from a fourth
rifle found his heart.
</p>

<p>
The woods were ringed with fire now, but the girl
was saved. When he saw that she had arrived at the
fort gate, McCullough ran from the block-house and
reached the entrance in time to catch her in his arms.
Her poor little Philadelphia finery was red with blood
from the wound in her neck, and her sweet young face
was covered with the same gory embroidery.
</p>

<p>
She dropped the powder at the feet of the colonel
and fainted in McCullough's arms, his own face
scarcely less white than hers. One agonizing glance
he gave to assure himself that her wounds were but
slight ones, and he had to leave her to the women, for
he was called to the walls.
</p>

<p>
While some of the women revived the girl, others,
by Colonel Sheppard's directions, broke open the
precious keg of powder and served it to the men.
Those who could do so, took their places, rifle in
hand, on the stockade; for the Indians and rangers
now came out into the open. Carrying a great log,
the Indians dashed recklessly at the fort, endeavoring
to batter in the gate, while they kept down the fire of
the defenders by the rapidity of their own discharge.
They reached the gate and hammered on it with their
ram; but the gallant little band within the walls, with
their women helpers behind them, poured such a fire
upon them that after heavy loss they retreated out of
range, disheartened by their failure.
</p>

<p>
The next morning brought Colonel Swearingen and
his militia levies, and at his approach the besiegers
gave over the attempt and withdrew. The post was
saved with the women and children. Elizabeth and
McCullough were the heroes of the occasion.
</p>

<p>
"How could you do it?" asked Hugh of the girl,
as they wandered together by the river that evening.
</p>

<p>
"I did it for you, dear," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"No, not only for me, but for the women and
children; you thought of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; but I thought more of you than of the
others, all the time. I knew you'd save me, Hugh.
I was sure you would not let them take me. 'Twas
your rifle&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, dearest, 'twas your shoe." He took it fondly
from his coat and kissed it. "This little shoe that
turned you aside and gave me an opening. God forbid
I should ever have to do such shooting again, dearest."
</p>

<p>
"Amen, Hugh, and yet He guided the bullets, I
think."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, truly. And I never dreamed that you were
such a heroine, Elizabeth. Where did you learn it?
Not in Philadelphia, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"No, Hugh, there is but one school in which they
teach those things."
</p>

<p>
"And that is the school of&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Love," she whispered, hiding her head in his
breast.

<p>
Among the most devoted of my parishioners
was a certain Mrs. Allen,&#8212;devoted to
the Church, of course, that is; although,
if I may judge from her actions, I think
she held me personally in high esteem
as well. When I became acquainted with her she was
a widow with one son. Other children, girls, had been
born to her I learned afterward, but she had lost them
in their early childhood; and, after the death of her
husband, who had been a major in the marine corps
of the United States navy, her life had been entirely
devoted to this son, in whom her heart was so
wrapped up that she fairly worshipped him.
</p>

<p>
She was a gentle, quiet, retiring little woman, sad-faced
and inclined to melancholy when George, her
son, was not with her. He was a hearty, healthy lad,
abounding in strength and spirits, full of fun and mischief,
but never vicious, and he certainly adored her
with a genuine enthusiasm. His mother seemed
actually to bask in the sunshine of his presence, and
when they were together she was a different woman.
</p>

<p>
When I first knew them the boy had just been given
an appointment at Annapolis; and though he graduated
at the head of his class and should naturally have gone
into the line of the navy, he had followed the family
tradition by electing to serve in the marine corps, as
his father and grandfather before him had done. He
had risen to the grade of first lieutenant, and was one
of the officers of the little band of United States marines
who formed the Legation guard in Pekin during the
terrible summer of 1900. I well remember the fearful
anxiety and yet the superhuman resolution with
which Mrs. Allen confronted those days of silence and
suspense.
</p>

<p>
Sadly enough, among the first messages which got
through from the besieged ministers was one announcing
the death of her son. I was with her, of course,
immediately upon the receipt of the news. Her grief
was as silent as it was terrible. She made no complaint.
The blow just struck her down. Her heart
was affected in some way, and Dr. Taylor informed
me, and I, in turn, told her that her days were numbered.
I felt that it was best that she should know it.
Now that her son had been taken, the desire to live
left her, and she was almost happy in the thought that
a short time&#8212;a month or two at most, the doctor
said&#8212;would unite them again.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the receipt of the first bad news,
freedom of communication having been restored
meanwhile, the report of George's death was contradicted. Some one had blundered in the first message,
and things were in such a state we could never find out
who. He had been desperately wounded, they said,
but would recover.
</p>

<p>
His mother brightened under this encouraging
news. There was a faint rally and some improvement
in her condition, but nothing of a permanent character.
She realized the situation fully, but she summoned
all her resolution and determination to her assistance
and told me that she could not die until she
had seen her son again. Dr. Taylor thought that
probably she might survive under the inspiration of
her devotion until the boy, about whom we continued
to receive favorable reports, should come home
again.
</p>

<p>
So she lingered through the summer, struggling,
anxious, hopeful, determined. I happened to be with
her on the eventful day when she received his first
letter. The joy with which she took it from me and
tore it open with her white, feeble, trembling hands
was almost painful to witness. I felt as if I were
intruding upon a meeting; but her blank look of
astonishment changing to regret, and then to bitter
disappointment, even anguish, as she mastered its
contents was surprising.
</p>

<p>
"I have lost my boy," she said, with trembling lips,
after a while, as she handed me the letter.
</p>

<p>
"What?" I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; he is getting better and is coming back.
I do not mean that; but&#8212;but&#8212;he is going to be
married. Read it yourself."
</p>

<p>
Why, it was a letter to make any woman's heart
proud, I thought, and I said so. There were sober
words of thanksgiving to God that his life had been
spared; a modest expression of satisfaction in the promotion
to a captaincy, which had come to him for his
splendid courage during the siege, notably when he led
the attack on the sand-bag fort on the wall, where he
was wounded; and lots of love for his mother. That
was not all, though. He had been a demonstrative
boy always, I suppose; he had lavished affectionate
endearments upon her, and she had been first in his
heart; but now&#8212;ah, there was the rub.
</p>

<p>
I realized, as I reflected on the situation, that I was
only a man, and that no man had ever fathomed the
subtle depths of a woman's&#8212;a mother's&#8212;heart. It was
as she had said; he was going to be married. I must
admit that nine-tenths of the letter was filled with
descriptions of the young woman to whom he had
plighted his troth. He sang her praises with the blindness
of youth and the ardor of manhood.
</p>

<p>
They had met for the first time during the siege.
She had been a belated traveller who had been caught
in the Boxer uprising, and had been forced to take
shelter in the Legation. She had shown herself to be
a heroine, of course. Everybody was heroic in those
days. We all expected they would be, and they were.
After George had been wounded she had nursed him
back to life and won her way into his heart in the
process. It was all quite natural, certainly, and very
romantic. She was coming back with him. They
were to be married by one of the missionaries in the
Legation, where the romance had begun, as soon as
he was able to stand it, and he hoped soon to present
to his mother a new daughter, who was "the best, the
sweetest, the noblest little woman in the world, and
whom I love and adore with all my heart," and so on
until the end of the letter.
</p>

<p>
I thought myself that he might have spared her a
little of that; and, as I watched Mrs. Allen's face and
tried to talk to comfort her, I began to have a dim
realization of what a shock it was. That boy had
been everything to her, as I said, and she to him.
She had always been first in his affection and he in
hers. Alone in the world, the two had grown up together.
Now that his life was spared, she confronted
the fact that she was called upon to share him with
another woman.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the bitterness of jealousy in old age! It was
there. Oh, the hopeless feeling that comes over a
mother when she realizes that, in a certain sense,
she is supplanted! I saw it in the white face, the
pressed lips, the trembling hands of the stricken woman
leaning back in the chair before me. It matters not
that it is the usual course of life; that did not make it
easier for her. Other mothers had to bear such things,
we both knew, but now it seemed different.
</p>

<p>
Well, I comforted her as best I could, said all
things possible before I left her, but to little purpose,
I fear. The next day she was dead. The second
shock had been too much for her. I was with her
when she passed away. When I came into the room
I noticed that the table by her bed was covered with
a pile of common red-backed blank books, which I
had never seen before.
</p>

<p>
"Sonny Boy!"&#8212;that's what she called him; in spite
of the fact that he was a great big fellow, and as manly
as a soldier should be, he was always in her heart what
he had been as a child&#8212;"Sonny Boy's diary," she
whispered to me; "I want you to take them&#8212;keep
them until he comes home and then give them to him.
And I want you to read them, too, so that you may
know&#8212;and&#8212;and&#8212;sympathize."
</p>

<p>
Sympathize with whom? I wondered. With George
or with her? Ah, I soon found out. I thought she
had gone after the prayers had been said, she lay on
the bed so still and quiet. But she opened her eyes
presently and whispered brokenly in the silence,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Tell him&#8212;I love him better than&#8212;than&#8212;any one
in the whole world&#8212;will&#8212;ever&#8212;love him&#8212;Sonny&#8212;Boy."
</p>

<p>
After that her eyes remained open until I closed
them.
</p>

<p>
I took the books home, and the evening of the day
of the funeral I sat down to read them. It was late
at night, or rather early in the morning, when I
finished them, and then I did something for which my
conscience has troubled me ever since.
</p>

<p>
I wish that I could tell you all that was in those
little worn blank books. Every word of them had
been written by her own hand. She began with his
birth, the first entry being made as soon as she was
able to hold a pen. She chronicled religiously every
event that bore even the remotest relation to the boy.
You could see how he grew into her life, how he
became a part of it, and, finally, as the years passed
by, all of it. There was nothing that he did or said
which was not noted. His most trivial actions, his
most unimportant words, were all faithfully set down
and commented upon. In those books was the history
of the development of a human being,&#8212;nay, the
development of a great passion as well.
</p>

<p>
As he grew older, and his mother lost successively
his father and the two little girls, it was easy to see
how the boy became more and more to her. The
entries were longer and more connected,&#8212;more coherent,
I should say. There were whole pages filled
with her speculations concerning him. She set down
the ambitions she had cherished for his work, the
hopes born in her heart for his future, her dreams of
his achievements that were to be; she quoted freely
from his letters when he was away at school. She
inserted photographs of him in all stages of development.
She wrote out the prayers she made for his
welfare.
</p>

<p>
The entries abounded with expressions of her ever-growing,
absorbing love for him. Yes, and when he
had his boyish flirtations and had evidently written to
her about charming girls he had met, the jealousy of
a mother's heart spoke in her comments. It was
quite evident to me as I read on, absorbed in it all,
that she would never be able to bear the idea of any
one coming between her and that lad. How she
rejoiced in his successes and love for her! There
were troubles, too,&#8212;illnesses, scrapes; but her love
never wavered, and things always seemed to come
right in the end.
</p>

<p>
I could see that the keeping of that diary had become
a passion with her. She confessed herself to it
as a devotee might to some spiritual adviser. She
poured out her heart on those pages which no living
eye but mine had ever seen, I verily believe. She
was absolutely true; entirely frank. The book was a
self-revelation, all unconscious. I could see the ennobling
effect of that great passion. She grew greater
as I read on and on. A soul was laid bare in the
written pages. I seemed to be treading on hallowed
ground as I tenderly turned the faded leaves. No
one could ever have spoken aloud as she wrote. It's
not in nature to do so. It was her secret heart, her
most sacred feelings, her inmost soul that lived and
vibrated in the silent letters. I seemed to be looking
upon things not meant for mortal eyes.
</p>

<p>
And through it all there was a note of depreciation.
Was she, could she, be worthy of him? Oh, the
sweetness of the humility of a mother!
</p>

<p>
But I cannot linger to tell all the story, all I read,
all I divined. At last came the entries of the present
year. When he had gone away she had sworn she
would be brave. He was a soldier, he must do his
duty and uphold the honored name of his father;
but, oh, the anxiety of it all! I could see that it had
almost killed her; yet she had kept up under the
dreadful strain until the news of his death came.
</p>

<p>
I am not ashamed to say that I put the book down
and cried like a baby when I read what she had
written. Broken-hearted sentences, bits of prayer,
words of Scripture, "Oh, Absalom, my son, my
son!" Tears on the pages. The leaves were alive
with her words. As I said, they spoke as no human
voice could have spoken. They told a tale which
humanity could not have revealed. And her heart
was broken.
</p>

<p>
Then came the entry on the day when I had told
her she was doomed. The subdued joy with which
she heard the news, with which she looked forward to
the prospect of a speedy meeting, was quite evident.
One phrase struck me on that page:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"The work of years is over; I lay down the pen,"
she had written. "Sonny Boy"&#8212;she never failed
to use that title; she clung to it the more tenaciously
as he grew older; it seemed very sweet to me&#8212;"is
gone and I am going, thank God! In death as in
life we will be together. 'The book may close over'
and be opened no more. He cannot return to me,
but I shall go to him. I shall write no more. I have
left directions that this story of a life&#8212;or two lives,
his and mine&#8212;shall be burned when I am gone to
meet Sonny Boy."
</p>
</div>

<p>
But on the next page the entries began again.
She had taken up her wonted life-long task once
more when she found that he was living. Curiously
enough, while there was joy in the pages now, I
seemed to read in them more of regret&#8212;in spite of
herself. The doom written against her could not be
revoked. Yet the conditions were changed. She
had to look forward to a long parting instead of an
eternal meeting, and it hurt her. Yet she must live
until he came back. I saw it was her will power
alone that kept her up. She must see him again
before she went out into the dark, or the light rather,
to wait for him.
</p>

<p>
So, in a hand that grew more feeble from day to
day, she jotted down her hopes and longings for her
son. How much the trembling letters told of her
growing weakness! how different were the characters
from the bold, flowing, graceful writing of the beginning!
</p>

<p>
Finally I came to the entry&#8212;the last&#8212;on the day
she had received the news of his approaching marriage.
Oh, the anguish that ran through the written
words! They seemed to gasp out her grief from the
page; sometimes I could scarcely decipher them. I
turned back to the entry following the report of his
death, and I declare it was no more heart-broken.
Another woman had come between them. With unconscious
cruelty, in that fatal letter George had told
her over and over again how much he loved the
woman he was about to marry. She could not get
away from it. Innocently enough, he had given her
to understand that he loved the girl more than all the
world. Thoughtlessly he plunged this dagger into
his gentle mother's heart.
</p>

<p>
I didn't blame him for his feelings. He could not
help them; and, as I said, it was human nature anyway.
The experience is common to every mother in
greater or less degree. She had to expect it, or she
ought to have done so. Still, I did wish he had not
been quite so enthusiastic; not that it would have
made much difference, for it was the fact that killed.
His mother had intuition enough, she loved him
enough to divine the truth through any reticence.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"I can't bear it," I read, "to know that I have no
longer the first place, that another woman is nearer
to him than I. To feel that the first of his love is
given to a stranger! The best of his heart is hers!
Who is she? What right had she to come between
us? What has she done for him compared to me?
Ever since he was first put in my arms, ever since I
heard him cry the first time after the awful pain and
anguish of deliverance, he has been mine! Mine!
Mine! And she has taken him! Oh, God, pity
me! I cannot give him up and live! He must not
bring her here. I shall never like her! I hate her!
I do not believe she is&#8212;Oh, how wicked I am!
And he will be so happy while I suffer! I'm glad he
will be happy&#8212;but it kills me. Thank God! it will
not be for long. I don't want to see her. Pity me,
my Saviour! You had a mother! I am an old,
lonely, dying woman. Mercy, mercy! I don't want
to see him&#8212;either&#8212;that I should write it&#8212;my son!
with a light in his eyes and love in his voice for another
woman. I shall die now. Perhaps I may find
comfort then. But I shall never forget. He wrote
about her on seven pages of his letter, and one was
enough for me. Oh, Sonny Boy, to lose you, to&#8212;your little old mother is breaking her heart! Be
assured of one thing, my son, I love you and I have
loved you better than any one in the whole world
will ever love you"&#8212;these were the words she had
whispered to me on her death-bed&#8212;"no matter how
much joy you may have, how much happiness, no
matter where you may go, whom you may meet, what
they may say, no one in this world will ever love you
as I have. No one will ever think of you as your
mother."
</p></div>

<p>
That was all. And I'm afraid it was true.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">    "There is none</p>
<p>In all this cold and hollow world, no fount</p>
<p>Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within</p>
<p>A mother's heart."</p></div></div>

<p>
I sat there in the gray of the morning with the
open book in my hand. She had told me to give
the volumes to George when he returned, and I could
not&#8212;if I desired to do so&#8212;disregard her wish; yet
to lay before him the sorrow, the regret, the sadness
of that last entry: to leave with him that final thought
of his mother, to cloud his wedded life with a suspicion
which I knew he could never dispel, that his joy had
been her death, his marriage had broken her heart&#8212;I
could not do it! Still, to withhold from that boy
the last words of his mother&#8212;it did not seem right!
</p>

<p>
What did I do? you ask. Well, with a horribly
guilty feeling, I cut the last leaf containing those
terribly piteous words out of the diary. I did it
carefully so that he would never know that anything
had been taken away. I felt like a thief all the time,
somehow.
</p>

<p>
I did not destroy the leaf. I could not do so. I
put it away carefully with my other treasures, and
when George came home with his sweet, beautiful
young wife,&#8212;and I thanked God he had her to help
him bear his unfeigned sorrow at the loss of his
mother,&#8212;I gave him the diary without the missing
leaf; and her last message to him, as I delivered it,
was one simply of love and blessing. And I almost
felt as if his mother thanked me for it. I hope so.
</p>

<p>
I take out that missing leaf sometimes when I am
alone in my study, and read it over and wonder
whether, after all, I did right or not.

<p>
The second dog-watch, from six to eight in the evening, is the sailor's
play-time. Unless some emergency requires it, drills and duties are
suspended for the time being and Jackie, except for supper, has his
time to himself. The older seamen usually collect on the forecastle;
sometimes in the lee gangway in rough weather. There they sprawl
themselves on the deck, or dispose themselves comfortably against the
rails or the bitts, or even the anchor-fluke, if every place is
occupied, or the boom boats if the waist be the place of assemblage,
and smoke their pipes and yarn.
</p>

<p>
The ordinary seamen, the landsmen, and the ship's
boys, if they are not rigorously excluded from the
top-gallant forecastle, or from close proximity to the
group of worthies who literally "take the deck," are
forced to stand afar off, at any rate, where they listen
to marvellous recitals as best they can. The midshipmen, however, as a species of privileged intermediaries
between officers and men, often make a part of these
exclusive circles, especially when yarning is going on.
</p>

<p>
Among all the tellers of strange tales on the famous
United States frigate <i>Neversink</i>, Jack Lang, the old
bo's'n's mate, held the chief place by general consent,
and the sound of his deep voice raised in narration
was sure to attract to his side every available reefer
not specifically on duty, and all the old shellbacks,
to whom yarning and listening to yarns were as the
breath of life. And nowhere will you find better listeners
than at a dog-watch "gam" on a ship's forecastle.
The old man's services on the <i>Neversink</i> were
invaluable in every way, his word was law forward of
the mast as the captain's was on the quarter-deck,
and even as a story-teller he was supreme.
</p>

<p>
One mild, pleasant evening this before-the-mast
autocrat and raconteur found himself the centre of an
interested group on the forecastle. The midshipmen
were burning for a yarn. They had learned, however,
that the surest way not to have their desire gratified
was to ask a sailor for a story. Certainly this was
true of this particular old salt, and it was necessary to
approach him by indirection. The conversation
turned, as it frequently does in the forecastle, on the
quarter-deck, and everywhere else, on woman.
</p>

<p>
"Wot's the matter with leetle Sammy Bowline?"
queried the old man in a pause in the conversation.
"I seed him a-weepin' an' a-bellerin' like wot you
Yankees call a 'caow' in the fust dog-watch."
</p>

<p>
"A cow don't weep, Jack," answered a maintopman who had been a lumbering bucolic dairyman
when the <i>Neversink</i> left port six months since, but
who was now a smart young light yardman.
</p>

<p>
"Hev you seen all the cow critters on the yearth,
youngster?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, some cows weeps, I sez, an' this'n' did,"
answered the old sailor, sententiously. "Anyway,
Sammy Bowline, he bawled awful."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon he's homesick fer his ma," remarked
Billy Clumpblock, the captain of the maintop. "I
just guv him a few teches with me colt to take it
out'n him, w'ich I've larned that w'alin' is werry good
fer homesickness, an' sent him up in the top, as he
calls it, to 'spell a watch.'"
</p>

<p>
"It's a sing'lar thing," continued the old bo's'n's
mate, "how much men an' boys thinks of feemales,
sech as mothers an' sech like pussons. It stands ter
reason thay ain't necessary to nobody's existence,
though it's agreed that we all had 'em onct, though
I've got no evidence of it in my own case 'ceptin'
general report. Look at this ship, now. There ain't
a woman on board of her, an' if they was, she'd be
considerably disorganized, w'ich I means the ship an'
p'raps the feemale too."
</p>

<p>
"They seems ter be necessary on shore, though,"
remarked the chief quartermaster, a much-married
man.
</p>

<p>
"P'raps they be. But they're no 'count on sea."
</p>

<p>
"I've heered them called the weaker sex," said the
purser's yeoman, who was fond of literature of the
dime novel variety. "I guess that's becus they can't
make sailor-men out'n 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Wall, naow," drawled the Jack-o'-the-dust, a
studious New Englander, given to historic research as
he could manage it, "there hev been wimmin sailor-men.
I've read abaout 'em. There was two pyrates
once an' they was wimmin. An' they was the wust
kind of pyrates, too."
</p>

<p>
"That's nateral," said the autocrat of the forecastle;
"it stands ter reason that a woman'd be a bad sailor
an' she'd also make a bad pirate."
</p>

<p>
"They wus good pyrates," continued the down-easter.
</p>

<p>
"Good pirates? There ain't no sech thing,"
chimed in another sailor, filling the responsible position
of captain of the hold.
</p>

<p>
"I mean they wus bludthirsty feemale villains, an'
they done the pyrate bisness up jest's fine's if they'd
a-bin men."
</p>

<p>
"I had an amazin' experience with wimmin onct,"
said the old bo's'n's mate, reflectively.
</p>

<p>
"I should say you had," broke in a young midshipman;
"I've heard you speak of your 'ol' woman'
hundreds of times, and all the trouble you've caused
her."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean her, Mr. Bobstay. God rest her
soul; she's dead, sir; an', as fer the kids, my darter's
married an' the boys is God knows where. I brung 'em
up ter be good sailor-men, though, an' wherever they
is, I guess they're a-doin' of their dooty. This was
another kind of a feemale. You see, lads an' young
gentlemen all, in the Med't'ranean in 1800 I was
bo's'n's mate, an', like this yere ship, we didn't kerry
no bo's'n on the little hooker <i>Grampus</i>, the luckiest
barkie that ever carried the American flag. She was
schooner rigged w'en I was on her. Then they turned
her inter a brig, an' now they're thinkin' o' makin'
a full-rigged ship of her. They've done everything
they kin to spile her. She's the slowest old tub afloat
now, I'm telled, but let anything British take arter her
an' she jest naterally takes a bone in her teeth an' rips
away. Lordie, to think of that little ship a-doin' all
the things she's done! Wall, where was I, mates?"
</p>

<p>
"You wa'n't now'ere. You was gittin' ready to go
som'er's, tho', I guess," said the quartermaster.
</p>

<p>
"To be sure. Wall, as I was sayin', I was bo's'n's
mate, an' that was bein' ekal to bein' bo's'n on that
'ere schooner, an' Commodore Rattlin was jest takin'
command of her. My, but he's a sailor an' a fighter!
I never seed any one like him an' I have fit in some
right good hard battles sence, onless 'twas Commodore
Paul Jones, w'en we tuk the <i>Serrypis</i> nigh onto forty
years ago. I was a smart young foretopman in them
days, lads, an' it was me wot the commodore sent out
on that main-yard-arm to drop them grenades down the
hatchway of the <i>Serrypis</i> that blowed her up. So I
allus thought that I won a deal of that battle myself,
though the commodore got the most credit. Let's
see. W'ere was I?"
</p>

<p>
"You was on the <i>Grampus</i> w'ich Commodore
Rattlin was takin' command of," said the Jimmy-Legs,
lighting his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"So I was. So I was, tho' he was only a leftenant
then, lads," continued the old man. "Wall, we was
mighty keen for prize money in them days, an', fer
that matter, I ain't never seed the day, so far's I'm
consarned, w'en I wasn't ekally desirous of gittin' my
share of the same. Now, you youngsters, an' you
haymakers,&#8212;w'ich is a bit unjest to you, p'r'aps, becus
you've larned to be putty fair sailor-men sence we
tuk our departure from Boston,&#8212;ye know prize
money's divided into twenty parts by the laws of
the United States. The cap'n he gits three parts; the
leftenants an' sailin'-master, they gits two parts; the
marine officers, surgeon, purser, bo's'n, gunner, carpenter,
master's mates, an' chaplain, they gits two;
three parts goes to the steerage an' chief petty officers,
the other petty officers gits three, an' the balance of
the crew gits seven."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me the crew don't git no fair share,"
interrupted one of the new hands.
</p>

<p>
"We're lucky to git anything at all," commented
the old sea philosopher. "They used to say you
throwed the prize money at a ladder. Wot went
through was diwided betwixt the cap'n an' th' officers
an' petty officers, the cap'n takin' the biggest share.
Wot stuck to the rounds was fer the crew. An' if
they hadn't tarred the rounds in sum instances I
knows of," he went on, mendaciously, "they wouldn't
a-got none. Howsomever, this yere explanation is
necessary fer to understand this yarn."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know wot prize money's got to do with
wimmin," remarked Billy Clumpblock.
</p>

<p>
"My lad," said the bo's'n's mate, sapiently, "prize
money's got a lot to do with wimmin, as you'll find
out, especially if you go ashore with a pocketful of
it. It had suthin' to do with the wimmin I'm goin' to
tell ye of, anyway. One pleasant day in December,
1803, we was a ratchin' to an' fro in the Med't'ranean
on the <i>Grampus</i> a-lookin' out fer Algerian cruisers,
w'en we run acrost a ketch."
</p>

<p>
"What's a ketch, Jack?" asked one midshipman.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a ketch&#8212;an' the rest on you pay attention,
too; if ye just take notice to wotever I says, ye lubbers,
you'll soon know a heap about the sea an' other
things. Bein' a silent man myself, I don't say much,
as ye may hev noticed; therefur, w'en I do say suthin'
it's wal'able. A ketch is a wessel wot has one big
mast set well aft about midships an' a little one way
aft of the fust one. This is to leave a cl'ar space
forrard fer a bum [bomb]. They're mostly used fer
that, w'ich is w'y they are called bum ketches, ye
know. This one, however, had a cargo more dangerous
an' onsettlin' than bums would ha' been, fer w'en
we ranged alongside an' throwed a shot over her, you
never heered sech a screechin' an' yellin' in all yer life.
</p>

<p>
"'Good Lord!' said Cap'n Rattlin out loud, w'ich
as he was young an' impulsive like an' not used to
controllin' his feelin's like me, he jest spoke right out.
'Good Lord!' he sez, 'wot hev we run inter?'
</p>

<p>
"'It 'pears to me,' spoke up Mr. Parbuckle, actin'
as his first luff, w'ich he was only a midshipman an'
had no experience wotever with the feemale sex,&#8212;but
I've allus noticed that it's them as has little experience
as knows the most, specially 'bout wimmin,&#8212;'it 'pears
to me,' he sez, 'that them's wimmin.'
</p>

<p>
"'Wimmin?' roars the cap'n. 'Wot are they
a-doin' there? Well,' he sez, 'we'll soon find out,'
sez he. With that he shoved the schooner in clus to
the ketch an' hailed her. Of course, the conwersation
bein' carried on in lingo Franco, w'ich I understands,
it was all werry clear to me, an' I told the rest of the
fok's'l wot was happ'nin'.
</p>

<p>
"'Ahoy!' the cap'n cried, 'wot ship is that?' An'
then a measly old Turk he come over to the side an'
throwed his flag in the water an' waved his arms an'
bowed to the deck, but didn't say nuthin'. He was
so skeered he was most frightened out of his baggy
britches. He could see the smokin' matches, an' we
was jest itchin' to turn our guns loose on the old
heathen, with his wildcats, or wotever they was. The
cap'n bein' young an' impetuous like, he hails ag'in.
He sez,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"'W'y don't you answer me?' he sez. 'Ain't ye
got no tongue?' he sez. 'Don't you hear me?
W'ere are you from? W'ere are you bound? Wot
hev ye got on board? If ye don't speak up I'll turn
a broadside on ye.'
</p>

<p>
"With that that old Turk he unstoppered his jaw
tackle an' reels off an extr'ordin'ry lot o' stuff, but
we makes out, me an' the cap'n does, that he was
from Tripoli three days out. That his ketch's name
was the <i>Stamico</i>, or sum sech other outlandish name,
an' that she was loaded with feemale slaves fer the
Sultan of Turkeys.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh-o'-mighty, if the cap'n hadn't insisted all the
time on the most sharpest dissypline on that there leetle
ship, I'd a yelled an' laughed outrajus, an' the men
would hev busted inter cheers. As it was, I didn't
dare to tell the crew all that bit of news; I jest guv
'em a leetle to keep 'em goin' an' hove to under the
lee of the foremast where nobody seed me an' cut
loose a few steps myself.
</p>

<p>
"'This is a putty how-de-do,' sez Cap'n Rattlin.
</p>

<p>
"'Wot'll we do, sir?' axes Mr. Parbuckle. 'Wot'll
we do with them feemale slaves? I reckon we'll
have to bring 'em aboard here, fer we can't let the
ketch go,' sez that youngster.
</p>

<p>
"He was as excited as any of us, an' I reckon the
cap'n was hisself, if the truth was to be told. Sech a
prize as that ain't picked up every day at sea, ye
know, shipmates.
</p>

<p>
"'You know old Commodore Ringtailboom,' continoos
Mr. Parbuckle, grave-like; 'you know, sir, he
wants a boat jest like this ketch for inshore work.'
</p>

<p>
"'You're right, sir,' sez Rattlin, werry solemn;
'take a boat, Mr. Parbuckle, an' go over there an'
tell that beastly Turk we'll have to transship his cargo
over here aboard the <i>Grampus</i>.'
</p>

<p>
"I was cox'n of that boat, young gentlemen, an'
we went off armed to the teeth, not so much fer fear
of the Turks, but on account of them feemales. You
see, we didn't know wot'd happen to us with a ketch
load of wimmin folk, an' we went prepared fer the
wust. Wall, may I be jiggle-toggled, shipmates, but
sech a screechin' an' yellin' you never heered w'en
we got aboard. Bein' a chief petty officer an' the
next in command, as it was, an' the most experienced,
bein' a married man, Mr. Parbuckle, he tells me to go
below an' see wot I could make out of the lot, w'ile
he speaks to the beastly Turkey cap'n. Fer a reefer,
young gentlemen," said the old sailor, "he was the
bashfullest feller I ever seed. 'Tis a rare and onsettlin'
quality in the class,&#8212;meanin' no offence," he
added, amid a general laugh, in which the midshipmen
heartily joined. "I didn't want nuthin' better'n
that job, so I jumped below to tackle it, took off my
hat, an' sez, most pleasant like, 'Ladies, yer most
obejient an' 'umble sarvant.'
</p>

<p>
"They all run forrard at that an' crowded inter the
eyes of the ship to git away from me. I suppose I
must ha' looked mighty fierce, wot with cutlass an'
pistol an' the pigtail we allus wore them days, an'
w'en I tried to tell 'em that I come peaceable like,
they was makin' sech a noise that they didn't seem
to pay no 'tention to wot I said. I thought the best
way to ca'm 'em an' to assure 'em of my peaceful
intentions was&#8212;well&#8212;er&#8212;I jest caught the nearest
one by the arm, slipped my own arm 'bout her waist,
an'&#8212;an'&#8212;smacked her good!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack, you old sinner!" yelled the youngsters
in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"Dooty, gentlemen; a true sailor-man is allus ready
to sakerfice hisself fer his country, an' I done it cheerful
then, bein' as 'twas in the line of dooty."
</p>

<p>
"I guess you did," said Midshipman Cringle,
sagely.
</p>

<p>
"Thankee, sir," continued the bo's'n's mate,
oblivious to the sarcasm. "She yelled sum at fust,
but she seemed to like it. Of course, I repeats, it
was all one to me, jest in the line of duty, as I sez,
though I hev done more disagreeable jobs than that.
I jest patted her on the head a bit w'en I got hold of
her, an' told her to ca'm down, that we wa'n't goin' to
hurt her, an' she seemed to feel summat assured, but,
as we arterwards larned, she didn't understand a word
I was a-sayin'! Howsomever, suthin' satisfied her.
Perhaps 'twas my actions. Well, now, you youngsters,
you must remember that I was younger then
than I am now, an' there wa'n't a likelier sailor-man on
the sea, ef I do say so myself. The rest of the cargo
stopped makin' that infernal noise w'en they seed wot
was happ'nin', an'&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Jack!" said Midshipman Futtocks, severely, "and
you an old man! I'm ashamed of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Futtocks," said the old sailor, "as I hev said,
it was strictly in the line of dooty, an' I was a young
man at that time, sir. Mr. Parbuckle, he ordered me
to pacify 'em, an' I was a-doin' the best I could. I
was only a poor ignorant sailor-man in them days,
an' couldn't be blamed fer a thing like that. W'ich
I've got more experience now, tho' I don't say I
wouldn't be willin' to sakerfice my feelin's to my dooty
again if 'twas demanded of me. Well, I got 'em
quiet by this means, anyway, w'ich I'm sorry to say
you blames me fer, but w'ich my conscience is clear,
an' I wish I could do it ag'in, an' I got 'em up on
deck, too.
</p>

<p>
"'How did you get 'em quiet, Jack?' axed Mr.
Parbuckle, who was busy arrangin' with the measly
old Turkey w'en he seed me a leadin' 'em from
below.
</p>

<p>
"'Well, sir,' sez I, 'I jest hauled alongside the
nearest one, hove to, laid her aboard, an' s'luted her
with a few light guns, an' the rest stopped a-yellin' at
onct.'
</p>

<p>
"'Gad, man!' said the youngster, 'you've a genius
fer dealin' with wimmin.' W'ich I tuk as a compliment,
altho' comin' from one with no experience.
Anyway, we got 'em aboard the <i>Grampus</i> all right
arter aw'ile, an' ranged 'em on the quarter-deck.
We didn't lose a solitary one, tho' they did beller
an' bawl wuss'n Sammy Bowline at gittin' into the
cutter. Mr. Parbuckle he was left in command of
the prize, an' he a-protestin' bitterly; but the cap'n he
sez he might send some of the prize over arter aw'ile
to keep him company, but fer the present they must
be mustered on the <i>Grampus</i>. Wall, we claimed that
they all must be diwided up accordin' to law, bein' a
lawful prize, an' we wasn't goin' to wait fer no prize
court, nuther. The cap'n, bein' only a boy, he was
in fer a lark like the rest on us, so he mustered the
crew an' he made a speech.
</p>

<p>
"'Men,' he sez, 'as you knows, the prize laws of
the United States diwides the prizes inter twenty parts.
There ain't no money, but there are one hundred an'
twenty feemale wimmin in this lot w'ich we've tuk.
That's six wimmin to a part. I gits three, an' I'll
make my ch'ice now. Ladies, yer most obejient,'
he sez, grinnin' at 'em, an' them a-grinnin' back,
becus, like me, he was young an' well favored them
days, an' the feemales was havin' great larks, too.
Then he steps forrard and picks out eighteen of the
youngest and purtiest. Among 'em was the one I
endeavored to impress myself on the ketch, an' as she
passed me she made languishin' eyes at me; but she
had to go with the rest, me bein' only a bo's'n's mate.
So the cap'n he ranged his eighteen aft on deck, then
the leftenants tuk their turn, an' the cap'n he chose
fer Mr. Parbuckle, w'ich he was on the prize an'
couldn't choose hisself, an' a mad young officer he
was, too, seein' plain wot was a-goin' on an' him not
there. Wall, arter the cap'n, the leftenants, an' the
chief petty officers tuk their share, blast my eyes if
there wa'n't left an assortment of the ugliest old wrecks
you ever seed&#8212;forty-two of 'em&#8212;for the crew, an'
them jest beginnin' to understand the game, too,"
said Jack, laughing, "fer they showed the greatest
willin'ness to be tuk. An' sum of 'em must ha' been
old enough fer grandmothers, too.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a  name="chose"><img src="images/009.jpg" alt="&quot;The cap'n he chose fer Mr.

<p class="caption">"The cap'n he chose fer Mr.
Parbuckle, &#8230; an' a mad young officer he was,
too!"
</p>

<p>
"We carried about eighty of a crew, w'ich meant
there wa'n't enough to go round. There was an awful
lot of protestin' from the crew on the <i>Grampus</i> over
this yere diwidin' business. They said it wa'n't no fair.
But the cap'n, he sez, it was accordin' to law, an' we
was lucky to get what was there, an' to hurry an' pick
'em out. So we turned to, an' then sech a screamin'
you never seed! Each woman had two men a-holdin'
each arm an' claimin' of 'em, an' we was a-pullin' an'
a-haulin' an' a-laughin' all over the decks.
</p>

<p>
"I tell ye, messmates, a shipload of feemales is the
most disorganizin' body that kin board a ship-o'-war.
Ef the old <i>Confederation</i>, the flag-ship, hadn't a-hove
in sight jest then, I don't know wot'd a-happened.
We was so okerpied in this diwidin' bisness
that nobody was a-watchin' out fer her. We was a-scramblin'
an' a-dancin' an' a-raisin' Ned, an' the
cap'n was a-protestin' an' a-tryin' to restore order,
w'en the old frigate shoved alongside, an' Commodore
Ringtailboom was that rageful he could hardly speak
w'en he sees us all. He settled the hull thing by
takin' all them feemales on board his own ship an'
then sendin' 'em to Algiers an' settin' 'em free till the
Turkeys got a hold of 'em ag'in, w'ich we never seed
'em ag'in. Cap'n Rattlin he got transferred to the
frigate to onct fer punishment, an' we was scattered
among the fleet, cos they said 'twarn't safe to leave
sech a crowd together no more.
</p>

<p>
"Shipmates, we was only jokin' about diwidin' of
'em, but arter the commodore crossed our course we
was the maddest lot of officers an' men you ever seed,
but that was all there was to it. You can be sure that
nobody never got athwart the hawse of Commodore
Ringtailboom deliberate; he was a peppery old gent,
sure, an' 'twas as much as a man's life was worth to
go agin him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, that's an example of how disorganizin'
wimmin 'ud be on board a ship."
</p>

<p>
"Jack," said little Futtocks, amid the laughter with
which this amazing story was greeted, "do you mean
to tell me that this is a true yarn?"
</p>

<p>
"Hev I brung you up, Master Futtocks, to doubt
me?" asked the old man, his twinkling eyes belying
the resentment in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"I am not doubting you, Jack. I'm just asking
you a question."
</p>

<p>
"Wall, wall, I'll tell ye wot to do. The next time
you see Commodore Rattlin you jest ask him wot was
done with them feemale slaves we captured in the
<i>Stamico</i> w'en we was together in the old <i>Grampus</i> in
the Med't'ranean in 1803."
</p>

<p>
"But, Jack&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
"Eight bells, sir," said the old man, rising as the
four couplets proclaimed the hour. "All the starboard
watch!" he cried, shrilling his pipe as a sign
that the play-time was over.

<p>
Common sense&#8212;hard, practical common sense&#8212;is a great and
important factor in this world's concerns. I am not a common-sense
person myself,&#8212;though Geraldine will tell you that I am a man of
uncommon sense,&#8212;but it is to common-sense people that I address
myself; people who say, if they ever so far forget themselves as to
read "Rappaccini's Daughter," for instance, or that other story by the
gifted son of his gifted father, which hides its weird fascination
under the name of "Archibald Malmaison," and you ask them if they like
the stories: "Oh, of course not; I never heard of such improbable
things. Why, how is it possible for a man?" etc. It is to these people
I write.
</p>

<p>
I live in the enterprising Western city of Kalamalant.
As my family and Geraldine's family have lived there
many years, we are all well known, and any of my
neighbors, among whom are a judge of the District
Court, a retired major-general of the army, a United
States Senator, and other persons of undoubted
veracity, can affirm the truth of the strange incidents
of which I am the principal subject. Geraldine will
say that this is not the only case in which I am the
principal subject, royally assuming for the once&#8212;but
I digress. Geraldine says I always take too much
time in getting at the point of the story, and as
Geraldine is the only critic of whom I am afraid, here
goes.
</p>

<p>
I, James Henry Rettew, commonly called Harry,
was about twenty-six years old in the year of our Lord
1901. I was a sleepy, and people say a dreamy, abstracted
young man. Geraldine thinks me handsome.
She is alone in her belief, unless I agree with her in
this, as in most things. I was possessed of a little
fortune, and was a well-informed young man of studious
bent, having read largely in a rather desultory
way. My favorite study was the spiritual essence,
or soul of man, especially my own.
</p>

<p>
It is a thing I believe most people have, though
Geraldine says you have to take it on faith in the case
of a great many people. What was it? Where was
it, this pervading vital force within me? How did it
exist within my body? What kept it there? Was
death the result of a disassociation of the two? Was
no man capable of ever separating the one from the
other?
</p>

<p>
These are but a sample of the speculations in which
I indulged. And I actually found myself in the way
of solving some of these problems at last. Rummaging
in the library of a deceased philosopher, I came
across a treatise on this very subject by a sage of ancient
times, the learned Egyptian Archidechus. No,
you will not find his name in the encyclop&#230;dias. I have
purposely altered it, lest any one should search for the
pamphlet and, finding it, become as I was&#8212;but I
anticipate.
</p>

<p>
I seized upon the old moth-eaten parchment volume
with avidity. This rare&#8212;I do not think there was another
copy in existence except the one I read&#8212;and
wonderful book treated of the spirit or essence of life
as distinguished from the gross and visible body. The
writer held that it was possible to separate the one
from the other; in other words, according to Archidechus,
the spirit might leave the body and return to it
at pleasure; in fact, the writer knew of such a case
and cited it; he also gave minute directions for accomplishing
this wonderful feat. I shall not reveal
them to you nor to Geraldine, though that is the only
secret I do not share with her, so beware how you
confide in me.
</p>

<p>
Of course the thing was ridiculous; no such separation
was possible, so I reasoned. There were the
directions, however; they fascinated me. I was always
an imaginative fellow and a great tryer of all sorts of
strange experiments; why should I not try this one?
I confided my intentions to no one, not even to Geraldine.
I locked myself in my room and devoured the
old book. Great stress was laid upon the faith necessary
and the condition of the mind. It was stated
that any violent emotion might be of great assistance
at the final moment of&#8212;shall I call it dissolution?
</p>

<p>
Now I was at peace with all the world except John
Haverford. Haverford was in love with Geraldine
Holabird, but as I felt sure of her affection, I was not
able to get up any violent jealousy on her account.
Geraldine has since told me that if she had known
I felt so confident of her affection she would have
supplied me with several emotions on that score of an
exceedingly violent nature; I don't believe it.
</p>

<p>
However, I complied with the other directions, and
I even contrived to assume a reasonable amount of
faith, but I could not quite manage the separation.
I could apparently concentrate my vital force on one
spot, for instance; but, exert myself as I would, I
could not break the tie. The idea possessed me; I
could think of nothing else. Geraldine says I was
the most intensely unsatisfactory lover at this time
that one could imagine, and that she had serious
thoughts of giving me up for John Haverford.
</p>

<p>
Our love, which was a secret affair,&#8212;and none the
less sweet for that, by the way,&#8212;was violently opposed
by the heads of both our houses, there being some
grudge between them. Although I was devoted to
her and she to me, as I now know, though I did not
at the time, yet I had never dared to take more of a
lover's privilege than a respectful salute upon her
hand. Geraldine was a tall and extremely dignified
girl, and how she ever came to meet me clandestinely
and write me those little notes&#8212;I have them yet&#8212;I
don't know. She says she doesn't either.
</p>

<p>
But to come back to my experiment. My want of
complete success preyed upon me. I grew thin, lost
my appetite, could think of nothing but that. This,
I imagine, was one of the reasons for my final success.
Geraldine says I ought not to have said that, as it will
spoil the d&#233;nouement. However, it is too late now.
One afternoon, more than usually discouraged at my
repeated failures, when I was about to consign the
volume to the fire as a false prophet, my sister, who
acted as our Mercury, threw a note into my room
from Geraldine. I opened it, I must confess, rather
listlessly.
</p>

<p>
Good heavens! Her father had discovered my last
letter, he was furiously angry, swore she should marry
John Haverford, and she was now locked in her own
room; I would recognize it by the white ribbon hanging
from the window-sill, and I must do something
soon, for her father was terribly angry, and she loved
me and me only, her own Harry,&#8212;and you know the
rest! (Geraldine protests against these unflattering
allusions to her notes.)
</p>

<p>
What happened a moment after, or how it happened,
I am not prepared to state; one thing I do
know. I found myself in the street and, without a
thought of how I came there, was hurrying toward
Geraldine's house; with reckless speed I ran headlong
full-tilt into a lady of my acquaintance. The concussion
nearly stunned me. What was my surprise, as I
hastily took off my hat to apologize for my carelessness,
to see the young lady calmly walk past me,
apparently unconscious of my presence, and giving
no evidence of having been in a collision with me!
This rather astonished me, but Geraldine was so much
in my mind that I dismissed it and hastened on. It
was not far to her house, and, sure enough, there was
a white ribbon fluttering from the window I knew to
be hers.
</p>

<p>
In my reckless desire to do something for her, I
opened the gate and walked into the yard,&#8212;that is, I
found myself there, and, of course, could have come
no other way. I am not much of an athlete and
could not have jumped the fence. These reflections
did not occur to me at the time, but the next thing
which happened did astonish me. While I was standing
there in the walk, wondering what to do next, the
front door opened and old Mr. Holabird came out.
His face was red with anger, and he was armed with
a thick club, presumably for me. Now, I am not a
very brave man,&#8212;though Geraldine thinks me a perfect
hero,&#8212;and I confess I trembled. However, I
walked up to him and said, "Mr. Holabird, your
daughter&#8212;&#8212;"
</p>

<p>
He absolutely did not see me, and as he passed
me, with excess of courage I laid my hand upon his
arm, but he took no more heed of that than of my
voice. What could have been the matter?
</p>

<p>
I began to feel a little alarmed, and gave myself a
good pinch to see if I were awake, the usual resource
of people in a like situation&#8212;Geraldine says that no
one ever was in a like situation before. I certainly
was awake, for the pinch hurt me. Marvelling more
and more, I decided to go into the house. The old
gentleman was my most dangerous opponent, and
with him out of the way I felt I could brave the rest
of the household. If I could get at Geraldine, I
hoped to persuade her to fly with me; and I did not
doubt, once we were safely married, her father would
forgive us, or if he would not, I should not greatly
care, so long as I could have Geraldine.
</p>

<p>
Thinking thus, I walked up to the door and, placing
my hand on the bell, gave it a good strong pull. The
little silver-plated handle did not move an inch! I
rubbed my eyes and tried it once more&#8212;no effect!
I then sat down to consider. Was all the world bewitched?
I racked my brain until the door opened
and one of the children ran out. She came over to
the chair I sat in and dropped into my lap. I got
out of the chair in a second, just how I could not
say. I am not over-fond of children of that
age.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jennie!" I cried, somewhat indignantly.
"What do you mean by jumping on my lap in this
unceremonious manner? Where is Geraldine? Go
tell her I want to see her at once."
</p>

<p>
I was getting angry; but, would you believe it? that
child went on playing with her doll and completely
ignored me! It was too much; I wondered whether
the whole town were in a conspiracy to drive me crazy.
In despair I resolved to see Geraldine at once, and at
the risk of being shot for a burglar, I turned to the
door the little girl had fortunately left open and
walked in.
</p>

<p>
As I entered the hall my foot slipped on the marble
tiling and I fell heavily against an exquisite bisque
head standing on the newel post. When I picked
myself up, sufficiently sore from my fall to be convinced
that it was a real one, the bisque figure-head
was standing safely and smiling at me&#8212;it was a-laughing
head&#8212;in a way I conceived to be particularly
exasperating. I was so excited by this time that I
struck it a furious blow with my fist, and still that
infernal head stood and grinned at me!
</p>

<p>
If I did not see Geraldine soon I felt that I would
go mad, so I marched upstairs until I came to the
door of her room. I knocked gently on the door;
there was no sound! I tried the handle with the
same ill success as before. This was the last straw.
I confess I stood at that door and shouted and
screamed and kicked it,&#8212;pounded on it until I sank
exhausted on the floor,&#8212;and still no thought of my
real condition entered my head.
</p>

<p>
It happened that in my present situation my eyes
were just on a level with the key-hole. I peeped in.
There was Geraldine; I could see her plainly; and in
another moment I saw her take a letter from her
dress, kiss it passionately, and burst into a storm of
sobs and tears. I was so wrought up by this time
that in spite of my fatigue I jumped to my feet, and
in another second I found myself by her side.
</p>

<p>
She was clad in some soft white wrapper, her hair
all unbound, and was kneeling with her face in her
arms on a chair. I was inexpressibly touched by her
heart-broken attitude. I had never been anything but
a very formal lover, as I said before; however, I
thought the circumstances might warrant me in
waiving a little ceremony, especially as she evidently
needed a comforter sadly, so I walked quickly over
to her and laid my hand on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Geraldine," I said, "my darling, I am here to
help you. Geraldine, won't you speak to me?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer and no intermit to the sobs
and tears she was pouring on my letter. I thought
this was pushing shyness to the limit, and I had never
suspected her of being timid. However, as she made
no objection to my hand being on her shoulder, I
thought that was a good sign, and I knelt down beside
her and slipped my arm around her neck and
said,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Geraldine dearest, do not cry so,&#8212;courage,&#8212;it
will be all right&#8212;" (Pause.) "Won't you speak
to me? Please, please look at me!" (Longer pause.)
"Geraldine!" I shouted, savagely, "look at me at
once or I'll leave you forever!"
</p>

<p>
No response of any kind!
</p>

<p>
By heaven! What <i>did</i> it mean? I rose and
dropped into a chair, remarking,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"I'll sit here and look at you till you do get up and
say something to me, if your father comes in here
and kills me!"
</p>

<p>
So I waited and watched her. Presently she raised
her beautiful eyes, red with weeping, and fixed them
straight on me without the slightest sign of recognition,
not even the fear that would have filled them
had I been a stranger. What could be the matter?
</p>

<p>
I rushed over to the long swinging mirror in the
corner, determined to look at myself and see what
was wrong. I stood directly in front of the glass and
glanced at its bright surface to make a last effort to
solve the mystery. Reader, I will solemnly assert
that when I looked in that mirror, expecting to see
myself, <i>I was not there</i>!
</p>

<p>
There was nothing reflected there but the room
and contents and Geraldine beyond, completely oblivious
of me. She had taken a small picture of me
I had given her and was alternately looking at it and
pressing it to her heart. This evidence of an affection
which I scarcely dared to hope that she entertained
for me was certainly very gratifying, and at any other
moment would have filled me with happiness; but in
the light of the fact that I was not there, where I felt
myself to be, I was too horror-struck for anything else.
</p>

<p>
I stood mechanically glaring at Geraldine, at the
glass which did not reflect me, and at myself. I could
see myself with my own eyes perfectly, hear my own
voice distinctly, or touch myself with my own hands;
in fact, I could see and feel as well as ever. I resolved
to make one more effort.
</p>

<p>
"Geraldine," I said, softly. "Geraldine," louder.
"Geraldine!" in a perfect scream, "I am going to
kiss you this moment!"
</p>

<p>
She was lying back in a large chair, her hands listlessly
crossed in her lap and her eyes closed. I
walked firmly to her, hesitated a second, and then
bent and kissed her upon the lips.
</p>

<p>
She says now it was very ungenerous of me to have
taken advantage of her, but I submit that I had given
every possible warning of my intention, and besides I
was wrought up to such a pitch by the events of the
afternoon I scarcely knew what I did; so I kissed her
again and again, and this did really have some effect
upon her. At first she blushed a warm, beautiful
crimson, and as I kissed her a second and a third
time, she started, raised her head, opened her eyes
with a little scream, and said,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I must have fallen asleep and dreamed he was
here&#8212;I suddenly felt a kiss, it seemed&#8212;Oh, Harry,
Harry, why do you not come and help your girl?" and
her head sank back in the chair and tears came again
into her eyes. "Oh, Harry, why are you not here?"
</p>

<p>
I was nearly frantic by this time.
</p>

<p>
"Geraldine," I said, "I <i>am</i> here. I did kiss you,
really and truly, a moment ago."
</p>

<p>
But she paid no attention, and even while I was
speaking kept up her little agonized appeal for me to
come and help her. I rushed to the window, leaped
out on the porch, jumped recklessly to the ground,
dashed right into the arms of Mr. Holabird, ran
through the streets to my own house, burst into the
house, tore up the stairs to my room, and saw&#8212;what?
</p>

<p>
Myself, calmly and composedly lying back in the
chair with Geraldine's letter in my hand! This was
too awful; I sank down in the other chair, and as I
did so my eyes fell upon the volume of the learned
Archidechus. The mystery was solved! There in
the other chair was my physical body, and in this one
I sat, a disembodied spirit!
</p>

<p>
The explanation was so simple and evident it
brought great relief to me. Everything was explained.
Of course no looking-glass could reflect
the spirit of a man, no one could feel him&#8212;or it&#8212;or
hear him or see him; of course he could not
open doors or strike people or lift anything, though,
to be sure, no door could prove a barrier to such an
ethereal, immaterial entity as a disembodied spirit.
</p>

<p>
That accounted for my finding myself in Geraldine's
room in spite of the locked door, for the
child sitting down on my lap, for the bisque head
smiling at my buffet, for Geraldine's ignorance of my
presence. As to the kiss&#8212;well, love was the highest
and noblest sensation (love such as we felt for each
other) and as nearly a spiritually ethereal feeling as
any human one could be; so, when I had kissed her,
her spiritual being had responded to mine. This explanation
fell easily in with the rest.
</p>

<p>
So far as I was concerned, I was, to put it plainly
and simply, only my feelings and sensations; I was a
wandering sensation! Doubtless my spirit took the
same form as my visible body, but it was a thing so
utterly immaterial as to be absolutely invisible to the
human eye. I could talk, walk, see, and hear, because
I had all my sensations with me, the guiding
essence of my brain, too; but really my voice, for
instance, was not audible, because when I opened my
spiritual mouth it was only with the sensation of
speaking, and no real sound was made; or, to put another
explanation before you, my voice had become
refined in proportion with the rest of me, and was
pitched in such a sound-wave as the human ear was
not capable of receiving and concentrating.
</p>

<p>
At that moment this seemed very interesting to me,
and I settled myself comfortably back in my chair
and laughed long and loudly. Of course I could go
back into my own body at any time, and matters
would straighten themselves out at once. I sat speculatively
contemplating my body. It was a dramatic
moment, indeed!
</p>

<p>
My body was sitting in the chair in exactly the
same position I had been when I left it, or rather, I
should say, <i>we</i> had been when I left it. I bent over
and touched it&#8212;or him?&#8212;he felt warm and natural,
but not as if asleep. There was no beating of the
heart, no rise or fall of the breast as in breathing, the
eyes were opened and fixed but not glassy, the joints
appeared to be flexible still, though, of course, I
could not have moved one to see&#8212;in short, my body
presented every appearance of suspended animation.
I resolved not to try to get back into it just at present,
and was still sitting there speculating upon my double
self when the door opened and my sister&#8212;the one who
brought the letter&#8212;came in; she was my favorite, and
we were great friends. She glanced at me, and, supposing
I was asleep, drew a chair over to the window
and waited for me to awaken.
</p>

<p>
The fire was burning brightly in the grate, and, as
ill-luck would have it, a bright little coal sprang out
and fell on my lap,&#8212;that is, the lap of my body. It
seemed as if there was yet some sort of a connection
between us, because while the coal burnt into the leg of
my body, it was I who felt the sensation. I rushed
over to myself and attempted to brush it off. Of
course I could not. The pain was really unbearable,
and, forgetting my state, I called to Mary, my sister;
of course she did not hear me! This was a worse
dilemma than before. I decided at once to resume
my proper condition, when, horror of horrors! I
found that I did not know how.
</p>

<p>
It was true! I had been so constantly occupied in
endeavoring to get out of myself, as it were, that I had
completely omitted to learn the way to get in! This
was worse than anything previous. I forgot all about
the glowing coal which was still burning me, in the
dreadful possibility which rose before me. Suppose
they should bury me, would I suffer the pangs of suffocation
forever, or at least until my body resolved itself
into its primordial elements? I knew, of course,
my spirit would never die, and if my body did turn to
dust, would my spirit go with those of other departed
beings, as the Bible teaches us, or would the fact that
I had taken my spirit in my own hands, as it were,
condemn me to wander forever in my present state?
</p>

<p>
I certainly felt my spiritual hair turn gray. What
would become of Geraldine? Would I ever see her
again or, rather, would she ever see me? Would she
at last forget me and marry some one else, and force
me to stand powerless looking on? I ground my
spiritual teeth in rage and clinched my spiritual hand
and swore&#8212;but what was the use of swearing? I
could do nothing. I was too utterly ethereal, too
entirely disembodied to even haunt any one, too
ephemeral for a ghost even! Oh, horror! I thought
my brain would give way. I thought of everything I
could to help me out.
</p>

<p>
I had dabbled a little in hypnotism and had experimented
surreptitiously on various members of my
family, principally my sister Mary, and with some
effect. Now, hypnotism is the controlling of one will
by another. The will is an essential attribute of the
spirit; there is nothing gross about it. It is true that
the weakest and most physically imperfect specimens
of this twofold race of ours sometimes possess the
most powerful wills; plainly, then, body, physically considered,
had nothing to do with this will power which is
the secret of hypnotic force. Apparently I had my
will power in better shape for use than at any time in
my corporate body. I had it separated, under command,
and could concentrate it more easily and advantageously.
I would try it.
</p>

<p>
I got up, made the usual passes, and ordered Mary
to come and throw that coal off my leg. She did so
at once. I was delighted. She stood abashed and
silent in the presence of the, to her, hidden force
controlling her. It flashed upon me in an instant
I could cause her to open the volume of Archidechus
and turn the pages for me. Joy! No sooner said
than done.
</p>

<p>
I sat down beside her and willed her to do as I
directed. I hastily made her turn to the part which
treated of the resumption of the relationship; a new
disappointment awaited me&#8212;the learned Archidechus
stated that the individual in the case he
studied had never resumed his mortal condition, and
that the means of doing so were entirely unknown to
him. That took away my last hope.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically I released Mary from the influence
and then waited to see what she would do. Her
glance fell upon me, and she looked at me wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Why," she said, "how long Harry sleeps!" She
touched him on the shoulder. "Harry! Harry!"
and then she looked in his face and screamed.
</p>

<p>
The family, the servants, every one, came running
in. They filled my little room, and after narrowly
escaping being crushed to death by our fat cook, who
hysterically sank back in the chair in which I was sitting,
I walked over to the corner of the room and
waited. They picked him up and laid him on the bed,
and tried all the simple remedies they knew to revive
him. One poured brandy down his physical throat,&#8212;imagine
the sensation in my spiritual one,&#8212;another
one chafed his hands, one wetted a towel and struck
him repeatedly with it, the old-fashioned feather
was held under his physical nose&#8212;imagine my
spiritual sensation a thousand times intensified and
judge what I suffered.
</p>

<p>
I wished they would go away and bury me decently
and let me alone; it was too much to endure quietly.
I tried to hypnotize the whole lot, but unavailingly.
Finally the futility of their efforts dawned upon them
and they sat down to wait while one went for a doctor.
</p>

<p>
Doctor! I thought, contemptuously; what could he
do? unless, indeed, they might find a stray spiritualist
who could fulfil his promises and perhaps summon
my spirit back into its earthly shell. Sure, never had
I seemed so sweet to myself. If I ever got back to
myself again I made a solemn vow never to leave myself
on any pretext.
</p>

<p>
Presently the door opened and my father came in.
My mother was long since dead. The old gentleman
was almost heart-broken; he sat down beside me and
took my physical hand. (I find the pronouns very
confusing in endeavoring to relate this dual story.)
I would have given worlds to comfort him. Different
members of the family stood around the room talking
in low, hushed whispers of the dreadful fate that had
befallen me, exchanging reminiscences about me, extolling
me for many virtues I never possessed. There
was some consolation in hearing what a noble fellow
I was. I have not heard it before, nor have I heard
it since, except from Geraldine. Finally the door
opened and the doctor entered. He could do nothing
whatever, as I had foreseen,&#8212;he actually pronounced
me dead,&#8212;and a few hours later I found myself
neatly laid out in a coffin in the parlor,&#8212;that is, my
physical body was.
</p>

<p>
I took the most comfortable chair&#8212;when no one
else wanted it, of course&#8212;and waited for further developments.
This was growing interesting, and I had
become somewhat resigned to the hopelessness of my
situation. I noted several curious facts. After a while
I got very sleepy, intensely so, and lay back in my
chair and closed my eyes and tried to go to sleep. It
was no use; I could not. And yet I never so longed to
go to sleep in my life. The fact was, a spirit could not
sleep; and it was my body there in the coffin which
felt sleepy; but I must suffer for it. It was the same
way with hunger. I was hungry. I actually got so
desperate as to go out to the pantry and look at the
cold chicken and boiled ham there. I could easily
smell them; but as to the eating&#8212;oh, it was horrible!
I do not know how I got through the night.
</p>

<p>
The next day I could do nothing but sit and look
at the people who came to see me and hear what they
had to say. I have forgotten to mention that in my
condition I seemed to have as one of its attributes a
peculiar faculty of divining the real thoughts of the
people who came to look at me. Among them was
John Haverford. He was actually glad to see me; so
at least I read his thought. Geraldine thinks I must
have been mistaken; at any rate, the sight of him
filled me with so much rage that I rushed over to him,
I threatened him; I did more, I struck him, kicked
him, nothing of which he was sensible. It was too bad.
</p>

<p>
Geraldine did not come. I waited heart-broken for
her. Would she come? The old man surely would
not keep her. He was a pretty good fellow, after all&#8212;he
is devoted to our youngest daughter now. I
thought he certainly might bring her. I did not go
out I could not bear to leave my lonesome looking
body in the coffin. I had no heart for further adventures,
anyway. I was intensely cramped from lying
so long in one position. When I die I am going to
be cremated; no more coffins for me. My wife says,
however, she will not hear of that.
</p>

<p>
Geraldine told me afterwards that she passed the day
in longing for me to come and take her away, and
wondering why I did not, besides being continually
impressed with a premonition that something was
going to happen. Finally, toward night on the
second day of my anomalous situation, Mary&#8212;good
and faithful Mary&#8212;bethought herself to go and tell
Geraldine. On hearing the news that noble girl
promptly fainted. She recovered herself, however,
and through Mary's aid managed to get out of the
house and come down to see me.
</p>

<p>
I was looking at myself very dejectedly in the
parlor, half dead from loss of sleep, hunger, and
thirst, and wholly crazy from loss of love and my
dreadful prospects,&#8212;I surmised they would bury me
to-morrow,&#8212;when I heard the outside door open, a
familiar and yet nervous step sounded in the hall, and
then the parlor door opened. I had recognized the
step; it was Geraldine, but how changed! I forgot
myself and my trouble, and as she threw herself down
on her knees and clasped me in her arms and kissed
me, I suffered for her agony a thousand times worse than
for mine. Great heavens! Was ever man in such a
predicament? I bent over her in despair, and as she
turned her face up in prayer, I kissed her lips again.
She sprang to her feet and screamed,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is not dead! I am sure of it! I felt him
kiss me! I cannot be mistaken! Mary, send for
papa, and tell him to bring his newest and most powerful
storage battery along. I am sure Harry is not
dead; hurry, hurry!"
</p>

<p>
So it was from Geraldine herself that this new idea
of torture emanated. Oh, why could they not let a
disembodied spirit alone in its peaceful misery? An
electric battery could do no good, and it would be
worse than the burnt feather.
</p>

<p>
Old Mr. Holabird was an electrician and an enthusiast.
He would have sacrificed his best friend to an
experiment, and consequently did not hesitate to come
and practice upon me, whom he hated so bitterly
previous to the unfortunate dissolution of partnership
between my body and spirit. He was soon in the
parlor with a servant following him bringing the
battery. He was angry and astonished at seeing
Geraldine, but his experiment was too engrossing for
much time to be wasted upon her then.
</p>

<p>
Having obtained the consent of my father, he
began taking off my shoes and then my socks. I
blushed crimson; at least my spiritual entity did. My
physical body, I must confess, betrayed no evidence
of shame at the exposure; and before Geraldine, too!
Mary and father and the rest of the family looked on
with anxiety and little apparent faith. Geraldine
stood beside me, resting one hand against my breast
and looking at me as if not to lose the faintest sign of
life I might show. Her father, all business and energy,
attached the wires with a reckless want of ceremony;
I thought in wretchedly bad taste. I must confess I
hoped for the result of this experiment but faintly;
however, there might be something in it, so I stood
with my arm around Geraldine and my head resting
upon her shoulder&#8212;spiritually, of course&#8212;as the
connection was made.
</p>

<p>
I was quiet enough for just one-millionth of a
second, till I felt the power of the current. It was
awful; worse than any other experiment. I groaned
in anguish while that fiendish old man made the current
stronger and stronger, and that miserably placid
body of mine lay there as calm and as unfeeling as a
log, while I was in torment. I flew at the old man,
clinched my hands in his hair, grasped him around the
throat, did everything, and yet had to bear a current
strong enough to have killed a dozen men, added to
which was the anguish of feeling my last hope vanish.
I was doomed!
</p>

<p>
The scientific fervor of old Holabird was at last satisfied,
and he allowed the current to die down to one
of much less intensity, merely keeping, as he said, a
little on in case of an emergency. A little! It felt like
ten toothaches run into one, but was so much less than
before that it seemed almost like a caress in the first
moment of relief.
</p>

<p>
While I was standing there helplessly, wondering
what they would do with me, the old man walked up
to Geraldine, who stood wringing her hands, looking
at me, with her last hope gone, too, poor girl! and
said,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"Come, Geraldine, we must go; the man is dead."
</p>

<p>
"Liar!" I shouted; but no one heard me.
</p>

<p>
"And there is no use staying here," he continued;
"I tell you you must come. I promised John Haverford
that you would see him to-night. He asked me
for your hand, and I consented to-day."
</p>

<p>
Oh, I could have begged him to turn on the electricity
again; each pang fate had in store for me was
worse than before. Geraldine answered gloriously,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"But <i>I</i> have not consented."
</p>

<p>
"What difference? I say you shall marry him!"
he said, grasping her wrist.
</p>

<p>
"And I say I will not! I will be faithful to my
dear dead Harry here!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense! You shall marry Haverford! You
must!"
</p>

<p>
At this moment a strange thing occurred. Geraldine
wrenched herself away from her father, threw
herself upon the physical half of me, and whispered,
"I'll die with him first!"
</p>

<p>
Something passed over me as a blinding lightning
flash, and behold! The body in the coffin struggled,
sat up, clasped a trembling arm about Geraldine, and
exclaimed,&#8212;
</p>

<p>
"I am not dead, Geraldine. And you, you infernal
old villain, get out of my sight! Take off the battery;
give me something to eat and drink!"
</p>

<p>
The spirit had entered my body again. My love
for Geraldine and her love for me had wrought the
miracle, just as anxiety for her and love for her had
wrought the first change. Ay, through love the
world is made and destroyed.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing more to tell. My story was so
circumstantial that people generally believe it in spite
of the learned doctors, who hold it to have been
merely a case of suspended animation. In my mind
and Geraldine's, however, there is no doubt about it.
Besides, does not the learned Archidechus say&#8212;but
never mind; if it were not for this affair Geraldine
says she might have been years in finding out her
heart as she did when she thought me dead, and her
father never would have consented to our marriage as
he did.
</p>

<p>
He is very kind to us now, and we are very happy,
and have only anxiety lest my spirit should ever take
to wandering again. Geraldine says if it does she
will marry John Haverford, who is still pining for her;
but I know that is only a threat to prevent the dissolution
of partnership, as she confesses in private that
she would never marry any one but me&#8212;never!
</p>

<p>
I am very fat and well now, and have burned up
the parchments of the learned Archidechus, and am
training myself utterly to disbelieve such things. The
memory seems like a faint dream now in the light of
our present happiness, for Geraldine is the loveliest
and sweetest of wives, and says I am the best of husbands.
And giving her that last word, I lay down
the pen.

<p class="ctr">
By Cyrus Townsend Brady
</p>

<p class="ctr">
Illustrated. Decorated. 12mo. ornamented binding, $1.50
</p>

<p>
A comedy of cross purposes in the Carolinas, in which Mr. Brady has
done some of his most fascinating work in the weaving into romance of
historical fact and figure. The love story brings into the action two
peculiarly charming women of contrasting types, and these play
foremost parts in the plot.
</p>

<p>
The book is notable besides for its introduction of the figure of
General Greene, and for its account of the brilliant role he played in
the campaign in the South. Mr. Brady may always be depended upon for
brisk action and a wealth of incident. For all who enjoy adventure and
gallant deeds, and the winning of hearts, this novel will be a
delight.
</p>

<p>
It is a conspicuous example of beautiful book-making, bound in buff
cloth with brown stamping. It has the distinction of eight
illustrations from drawings by E. Plaisted Abbott, and decorations in
colors by E. S. Holloway, besides head- and tail-pieces.

"A perfect gem of a volume&#8212;one of the daintiest and prettiest that
ever came to the <i>World's</i> table."&#8212;<i>New York World.</i>
</p>

<p>
"It is written in a dashing style that cannot fail to hold the
interest, and shows up the character and bravery of General Nathanael
Greene."&#8212;<i>The Churchman</i>, Detroit.

"The publishers have spared no expense to make this volume one of the
daintiest novels."&#8212;<i>Baltimore Sun.</i>

bits of revolutionary history are cleverly set into the

"There is no striving after choice expression or artificial scenes,
but just the happy-go-lucky vivacity of the irrepressible raconteur,
and the coquettish Sarah is delightful. A cheerful bellicose
book."&#8212;<i>Brooklyn Eagle.</i>

"So pretty a specimen of book-making, illustrating the possibilities
of decorative art as applied to typography, as 'When Blades Are Out
and Love's Afield,' seldom comes in the way of a
reviewer."&#8212;<i>Nashville American.</i>
</p>

<p>
"This new novel should outstrip all Mr. Brady's preceding works in
popularity, for, while retaining the strength and virility of his
earlier books, it much surpasses them in heart interest and
charm."&#8212;<i>Argonaut</i>, San Francisco.

<p>
"A dainty love story. The book well repays the reading."&#8212;<i>The
Outlook.</i>
</p>

<p>
"The book revels in love, war, adventure, so what more can be
asked?"&#8212;<i>Detroit Journal.</i>
</p>

<p>
"There is just enough of war in the book to carry the spirit of the
times&#8212;there is just enough of the photography of the American
sentiment of those days to make the blood of to-day leap at the
injustice of yesterday. There is just enough of love to make the heart
go out to those who suffered in consequence of the duel of cross
purposes which runs throughout the story."&#8212;<i>New York Press.</i>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
